# P2–L2 Lattice Vibrations & Phonons
**Definition:** Follows how collective vibrations carry sound and heat through familiar solids.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- C1-L3_Phonon-Modes-&-Heat — describe vibrational spectra and how they transport energy.
- **C2-L3_Phonon_Engineering_and_Thermal-Flow** — ties phonon spectra to managing thermal energy.
