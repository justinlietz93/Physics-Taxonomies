# C2 Phonon Engineering and Thermal Flow — Book Suggestions

Engineering phonons enables designers to tailor thermal conductivity, manage heat, and harvest energy. These resources discuss scattering control, nanostructuring, and thermal transport modeling.

## Thermal Transport Fundamentals
- *Heat Conduction* — David W. Hahn & Robert H. Buckius. Lays out continuum models and boundary conditions that couple to phonon transport calculations.
- *Thermal Physics of Semiconductors* — Jens Küng. Connects microscopic phonon scattering mechanisms with macroscopic heat flow.

## Phonon Engineering Strategies
- *Nanoscale Energy Transport and Conversion* — Gang Chen. Discusses size effects, boundary scattering, and phononic crystal concepts for controlling thermal transport.
- *Thermoelectrics: Design and Materials* — David Rowe (ed.). Highlights lattice thermal conductivity suppression strategies for better thermoelectric performance.

## Measurement & Simulation
- *Time-Domain Thermoreflectance* — David G. Cahill & Paul E. Hopkins. Introduces pump–probe techniques for extracting thermal conductivity in thin films and nanostructures.
- *First Principles Approaches to Heat Transport* — Andrea Cepellotti & Nicola Marzari. Explains ab initio Boltzmann transport and Green–Kubo simulations for phonon flow.
