# O2 Scattering & Control Techniques — Book Suggestions

These resources survey methods for tailoring phonon scattering—through defects, interfaces, nanostructures, and external fields—to control thermal transport.

## Defect and Interface Engineering
- *Point Defects in Solids* — James H. Crawford & Lawrence M. Slifkin (eds.). Details how substitutional and interstitial defects scatter phonons and how to quantify their cross sections.
- *Thermal Conductivity: Theory, Properties, and Applications* — Terry M. Tritt (ed.). Includes chapters on interface thermal resistance and superlattice scattering strategies.

## Nanostructured Heat Control
- *Nanostructured Thermoelectric Materials* — Ken Kurosaki & Hanemann (eds.). Discusses nanoparticle and superlattice design that increases phonon scattering without harming electronic transport.
- *Nanoscale Energy Transport and Conversion* — Gang Chen. Provides analytical and numerical treatments of phonon scattering in nanowires, thin films, and multilayers.

## Active & Spectral Control
- *Phononic Crystals: Fundamentals and Applications* — Abdelkrim Khelif & Bahram Aïssa (eds.). Explores tunable phononic structures, defect modes, and waveguides for steering vibrational energy.
- *Thermal Energy Harvesting for IoT Sensors* — Mickaël Lallart (ed.). Highlights adaptive thermal interface materials and phase-change inclusions that actively modulate phonon scattering.
