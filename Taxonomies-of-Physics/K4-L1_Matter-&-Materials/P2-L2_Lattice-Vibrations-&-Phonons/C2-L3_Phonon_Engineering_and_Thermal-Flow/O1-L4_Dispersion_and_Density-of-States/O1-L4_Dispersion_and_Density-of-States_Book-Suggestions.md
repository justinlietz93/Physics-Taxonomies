# O1 Dispersion & Density of States — Book Suggestions

These references emphasize tailoring phonon dispersion and density of states (DOS) to engineer thermal and vibrational properties in materials and metamaterials.

## Phononic Band Engineering
- *Phononic Crystals: Artificial Crystals for Sonic, Acoustic, and Elastic Waves* — Vincent Laude. Introduces phononic band structures, band gaps, and dispersion control through patterning.
- *Acoustic Metamaterials and Phononic Crystals* — Pierre A. Deymier (ed.). Surveys design strategies for shaping dispersion surfaces and DOS features.

## Computational DOS Tools
- *Lattice Dynamics and Semiclassical Transport* — David G. Cahill (lecture notes). Covers practical methods for computing phonon DOS from dispersion curves and linking them to thermal transport.
- *Materials Modelling Using Density Functional Theory* — Feliciano Giustino. Includes workflows for projecting phonon DOS, partial DOS, and using them in thermodynamic predictions.

## Thermal Property Optimization
- *Thermoelectrics and Its Energy Harvesting* — David M. Rowe (ed.). Discusses how reducing phonon DOS or opening band gaps improves thermoelectric performance.
- *Thermal Conductivity: Theory, Properties, and Applications* — Terry M. Tritt (ed.). Provides case studies where DOS shaping via nanostructuring lowers lattice thermal conductivity.
