# C1 Phonon Modes & Heat — Book Suggestions

Phonons carry vibrational energy through crystals, setting heat capacity and thermal conductivity. These resources introduce lattice dynamics and statistical treatments of phonon populations.

## Lattice Dynamics Foundations
- *Introduction to Lattice Dynamics* — Martin T. Dove. Develops normal modes, dispersion relations, and symmetry considerations for phonons.
- *Dynamical Theory of Crystal Lattices* — Max Born & Kun Huang. Classic reference on phonon dispersion and polarization modes.

## Thermal Properties
- *Thermal Physics of Semiconductors* — Jens Küng. Connects phonon populations to specific heat and thermal transport in semiconductor materials.
- *Solid State Physics* — Ashcroft & Mermin. Provides Debye and Einstein models as part of the core curriculum.

## Experimental Techniques
- *Neutron Scattering in Condensed Matter Physics* — Albert Furrer, Joël Mesot & Thierry Strässle. Shows how inelastic neutron scattering maps phonon dispersion.
- *Raman Spectroscopy in Graphene Related Systems* — Ado Jorio et al. Demonstrates optical probes for phonon modes and thermal effects.
