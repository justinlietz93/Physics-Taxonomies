# O1 Normal Modes & Dispersion — Book Suggestions

These resources cover constructing phonon normal modes in crystals and interpreting dispersion relations that govern heat capacity and transport.

## Lattice Dynamics Foundations
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Develops 1D and 3D phonon dispersion calculations using dynamical matrices and symmetry arguments.
- *Solid State Physics* — Ashcroft & Mermin. Provides the general formalism for normal-mode analysis and discusses acoustic vs. optical branches.

## Computational Phonon Tools
- *Phonons in Condensed Materials* — Stephen Elliott. Explains lattice dynamics, dynamical matrices, and computational approaches for phonon spectra.
- *First Principles Calculations in Real-Space Formalism* — Hirose et al. Includes density-functional perturbation theory workflows for calculating phonon dispersions in realistic materials.

## Thermal Properties Links
- *Thermal Physics of Macroscopically Inhomogeneous Solids* — Anatoly M. Grishin. Connects dispersion curves with specific heat, Debye models, and thermal transport.
- *Heat Capacity and Thermal Expansion at Low Temperatures* — T. H. K. Barron & G. K. White. Demonstrates how measured heat capacities map back to phonon density of states and branch structure.
