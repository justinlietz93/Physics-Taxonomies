# S1-L7_Diamond-Heat-Sink — Species Index
**Definition:** Lab-grown diamond heat spreaders pull warmth from chips because phonons race with few collisions.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Diamond’s stiff bonds give phonons high velocities and long mean free paths, so heat diffuses quickly.
- Mounting chips on diamond plates flattens temperature spikes, preventing thermal runaway in electronics.
