# O2 Phonon Scattering & Heat Flow — Book Suggestions

These texts focus on how phonon scattering processes control thermal conductivity and how to model or measure heat flow in crystals and nanostructures.

## Scattering Mechanisms
- *Thermal Properties of Solids* — G. S. Nolas, J. Sharp & J. Goldsmid. Reviews Umklapp, impurity, and boundary scattering contributions to lattice thermal resistance.
- *Theory of Heat Transport in Nonmetallic Crystals* — B. T. Draine & P. G. Klemens (in *Solid State Physics*, Vol. 7). Classic treatment of phonon lifetimes and scattering phase space.

## Boltzmann Transport Modeling
- *Thermal Transport in Low Dimensions* — S. Lepri (ed.). Covers Boltzmann and Green–Kubo methods for phonon heat conduction in bulk and nanoscale systems.
- *Lattice Thermal Transport in Nanostructures* — Sebastian Volz. Provides numerical strategies for solving the phonon Boltzmann equation and assessing size effects.

## Experimental Techniques
- *Thermal Conductivity: Theory, Properties, and Applications* — Terry M. Tritt (ed.). Summarizes measurement setups such as time-domain thermoreflectance and 3-omega techniques.
- *Microscale and Nanoscale Heat Transfer* — Zhuomin Zhang. Links experimental observations with phonon scattering models, especially in thin films and interfaces.
