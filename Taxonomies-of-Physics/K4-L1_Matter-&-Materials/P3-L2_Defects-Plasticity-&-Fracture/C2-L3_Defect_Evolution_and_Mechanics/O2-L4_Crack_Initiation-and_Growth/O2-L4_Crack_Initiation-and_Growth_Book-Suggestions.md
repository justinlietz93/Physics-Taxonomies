# O2 Crack Initiation & Growth — Book Suggestions

These resources focus on how microstructural features trigger cracks and how cracks propagate under cyclic or monotonic loading.

## Initiation Mechanisms
- *Fatigue of Materials* — Suresh Suresh. Discusses microstructural fatigue crack initiation, inclusions, and surface effects.
- *Fundamentals of Metal Fatigue Analysis* — Julie A. Bannantine et al. Covers stress-life and strain-life approaches for predicting crack nucleation sites.

## Crack Growth Modeling
- *Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications* — T. L. Anderson. Provides analytical and numerical tools for modeling crack propagation under various loading modes.
- *Metal Fatigue: A Practical Engineering Approach* — Norman E. Dowling. Links Paris law parameters to material microstructure and loading spectra.

## Monitoring & Life Prediction
- *Damage Tolerance in Aircraft Structures* — Richard P. Gallagher (ed.). Demonstrates crack growth monitoring and inspection intervals in safety-critical systems.
- *Structural Health Monitoring* — Daniel Balageas et al. Explores nondestructive evaluation techniques that detect initiation and track crack growth in service.
