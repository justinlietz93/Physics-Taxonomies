# O1 Dislocation Dynamics — Book Suggestions

These texts address the motion, interaction, and collective behavior of dislocations controlling plastic deformation.

## Continuum & Mobility Models
- *Theory of Dislocations* — Hirth & Lothe. Details glide, climb, and interactions under applied stress, forming the backbone of dislocation dynamics modeling.
- *Dislocation Dynamics and Plasticity* — T. Mura. Introduces continuum formulations, Peach–Koehler forces, and mobility laws for moving dislocations.

## Computational Dislocation Dynamics
- *Computational Materials Science* — June Gunn Lee. Contains chapters on discrete dislocation dynamics simulations and numerical implementation details.
- *Dislocation Dynamics: Simulation and Physical Concepts* — Michael Zaiser (lecture notes). Provides modern perspectives on large-scale simulations and collective phenomena.

## Microstructural Evolution
- *Mechanical Behaviour of Materials* — Marc Meyers & Krishan Chawla. Explains how dislocation multiplication, forest hardening, and recovery shape stress–strain curves.
- *Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Methods* — Franz Roters et al. Links dislocation density evolution to macroscopic plasticity models used in engineering simulations.
