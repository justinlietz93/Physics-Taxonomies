# O2 Fracture & Failure Modes — Book Suggestions

These books outline the mechanics of crack initiation, propagation, and different failure modes in crystalline and polycrystalline materials.

## Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics
- *Fracture Mechanics* — Ted L. Anderson. Provides comprehensive coverage of stress intensity factors, fracture toughness, and fatigue crack growth.
- *Advanced Fracture Mechanics* — J. D. Broek. Focuses on mixed-mode loading, crack tip plasticity, and practical assessment methods.

## Microstructural Effects
- *Mechanical Metallurgy* — George E. Dieter. Connects dislocation activity, microstructure, and fracture mechanisms such as cleavage and ductile tearing.
- *Fracture of Brittle Solids* — Brian Lawn. Explains crack initiation in ceramics and glasses, including the role of flaws and residual stresses.

## Toughening & Failure Prevention
- *Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications* — T. L. Anderson. Chapters on toughening mechanisms provide strategies for raising fracture resistance.
- *Failure Analysis of Engineering Materials* — Charles R. Brooks & Ashok Choudhury. Presents case studies and diagnostic methods for identifying failure modes in service.
