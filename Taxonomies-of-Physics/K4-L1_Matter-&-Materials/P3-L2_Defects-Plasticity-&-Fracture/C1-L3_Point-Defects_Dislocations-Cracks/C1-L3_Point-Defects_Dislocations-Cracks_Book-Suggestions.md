# C1 Point Defects, Dislocations & Cracks — Book Suggestions

Defects break perfect periodicity, concentrating stress and altering transport. These resources cover point defects, dislocation mechanics, and crack initiation.

## Point Defects & Diffusion
- *Introduction to Dislocations* — Derek Hull & D.J. Bacon. Provides foundational concepts on vacancies, interstitials, and line defects in crystals.
- *Diffusion in Solids* — Paul G. Shewmon. Explains defect-mediated diffusion and its temperature dependence.

## Dislocation Mechanics
- *Theory of Dislocations* — John P. Hirth & Jens Lothe. Comprehensive treatment of dislocation energetics, forces, and interactions.
- *Mechanical Metallurgy* — George E. Dieter. Connects dislocation motion to plastic deformation and strengthening strategies.

## Fracture & Cracks
- *Fracture Mechanics* — Ted L. Anderson. Covers stress intensity factors, crack growth criteria, and fracture toughness measurement.
- *Advanced Mechanics of Materials and Applied Elasticity* — Ansel C. Ugural & Saul K. Fenster. Provides elasticity solutions needed to analyze crack-tip fields.
