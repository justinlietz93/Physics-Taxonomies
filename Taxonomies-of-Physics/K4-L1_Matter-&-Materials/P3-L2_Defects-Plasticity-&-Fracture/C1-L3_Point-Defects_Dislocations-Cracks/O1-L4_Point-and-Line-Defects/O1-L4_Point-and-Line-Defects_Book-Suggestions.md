# O1 Point & Line Defects — Book Suggestions

These selections introduce the structure, energetics, and effects of point defects and dislocations in crystals.

## Point Defect Fundamentals
- *Point Defects in Solids* — James H. Crawford & Lawrence M. Slifkin (eds.). Comprehensive treatment of vacancies, interstitials, and substitutional defects, including formation energies and diffusion.
- *Imperfections in Crystalline Solids* — Wei Cai & William D. Nix. Provides atomistic descriptions and continuum approximations for point defects and their strain fields.

## Dislocation Theory
- *Theory of Dislocations* — John Price Hirth & Jens Lothe. Classic reference on dislocation types, elastic fields, and interactions.
- *Dislocations and Mechanical Behaviour of Materials* — Marc Meyers & Krishan Chawla. Links dislocation motion to macroscopic mechanical properties.

## Characterization Techniques
- *Transmission Electron Microscopy* — David B. Williams & C. Barry Carter. Offers imaging strategies to identify dislocations and point defect clusters.
- *Diffraction Analysis of the Microstructure of Materials* — Eric J. Mittemeijer & Paolo Scardi (eds.). Shows how X-ray and neutron scattering quantify defect densities and strain fields.
