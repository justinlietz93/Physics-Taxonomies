# K4 Matter & Materials — Book Suggestions

Materials physics blends structure, mechanics, and collective excitations. These resources keep the scope broad so later branches can specialize in crystals, defects, and soft matter with a shared toolkit.

## Structure & Electronic Foundations
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Canonical survey of lattice structure, band theory, and excitations that inform the crystal and phonon phyla.
- *Solid State Physics* — Ashcroft & Mermin. Deeper theoretical treatment of electronic structure, response functions, and collective modes.

## Mechanical & Microstructural Perspectives
- *Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction* — William D. Callister Jr. & David G. Rethwisch. Connects atomic bonding to mechanical behavior, phase diagrams, and processing.
- *Mechanical Behavior of Materials* — Norman E. Dowling. Frames elasticity, plasticity, and fracture with design-oriented examples that span continuum and defect viewpoints.

## Soft & Complex Matter
- *Soft Matter Physics* — Masao Doi. Presents rheology, polymer physics, and colloids within a cohesive theoretical framework.
- *Structure of Materials: An Introduction to Crystallography, Diffraction and Symmetry* — Marc De Graef & Michael E. McHenry. Bridges crystallography with experimental probes used across the kingdom.
