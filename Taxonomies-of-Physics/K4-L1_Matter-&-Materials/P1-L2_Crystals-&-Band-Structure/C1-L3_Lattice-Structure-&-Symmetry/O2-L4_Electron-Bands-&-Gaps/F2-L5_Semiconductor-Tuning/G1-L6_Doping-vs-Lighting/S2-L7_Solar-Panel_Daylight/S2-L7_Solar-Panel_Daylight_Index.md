# S2-L7_Solar-Panel_Daylight — Species Index
**Definition:** Rooftop solar panels generate power because their band gaps match the energy in midday sunlight.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Silicon’s band gap lets sunlight kick electrons across the junction, leaving behind holes that drive current in a circuit.
- Doping creates built-in electric fields so the separated charges move directionally instead of recombining immediately.
