# O2 Electron Bands & Gaps — Book Suggestions

These references explain how periodic potentials split electronic levels into bands, how gaps emerge, and how to compute or measure the resulting dispersion relations.

## Band Theory Primers
- *Solid State Physics* — Neil W. Ashcroft & N. David Mermin. Lays out the nearly-free-electron and tight-binding derivations that produce band gaps from lattice periodicity.
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Provides side-by-side treatments of simple cubic and diamond lattices to show how symmetry shapes dispersion surfaces.

## Computational Workflows
- *Electronic Structure: Basic Theory and Practical Methods* — Richard M. Martin. Offers density-functional and pseudopotential techniques for calculating bands and identifying direct vs. indirect gaps.
- *Density Functional Theory: A Practical Introduction* — David S. Sholl & Janice A. Steckel. Walks through k-point sampling, convergence checks, and plotting routines for band structures and density of states.

## Experimental Probes
- *Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy* — Stephen D. Kevan & Dan Dessau. Shows how ARPES experiments map band dispersions and gap sizes in real materials.
- *Optical Properties of Solids* — Mark Fox. Connects interband transitions, absorption edges, and excitonic signatures with underlying electronic band gaps.
