# O1 Unit-Cells & Brillouin Zones — Book Suggestions

Unit cells and Brillouin zones give the coordinate system for periodic solids, so these readings emphasize constructing primitive cells, reciprocal lattices, and first-zone boundaries that feed diffraction and band-structure work.

## Crystallography Foundations
- *Elements of X-Ray Diffraction* — B. D. Cullity & S. R. Stock. Builds geometric intuition for lattice types, primitive vectors, and how to choose convenient conventional cells before heading into reciprocal space.
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Chapters on crystal structures and reciprocal lattices walk through the algebra that links direct-lattice metrics with Brillouin-zone volume.

## Reciprocal Space & Diffraction Maps
- *Solid State Physics* — Neil W. Ashcroft & N. David Mermin. Derives Bragg planes, Wigner–Seitz constructions, and reciprocal-lattice vector sets that define first-zone polyhedra.
- *Crystallography Made Crystal Clear* — Gale Rhodes. Offers visual aids and symmetry tables that help translate between real-space cell choices and reciprocal-space slices seen in diffraction.

## Electronic Structure Applications
- *Electronic Structure: Basic Theory and Practical Methods* — Richard M. Martin. Shows how Brillouin-zone sampling, k-point meshes, and symmetry reduction depend on the underlying primitive cell.
- *Band Theory and Electronic Properties of Solids* — John Singleton. Connects Brillouin-zone geometry with band diagrams, density-of-states sampling, and experimental observables like Fermi surfaces.
