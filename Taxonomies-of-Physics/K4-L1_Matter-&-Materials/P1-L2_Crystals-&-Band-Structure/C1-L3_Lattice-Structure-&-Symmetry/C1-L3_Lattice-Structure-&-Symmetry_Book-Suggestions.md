# C1 Lattice Structure & Symmetry — Book Suggestions

Crystal lattices organize matter into repeating motifs whose symmetries control physical properties. These references walk through lattice types, point groups, and symmetry analysis.

## Foundational Texts
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Covers Bravais lattices, reciprocal space, and symmetry operations with practical examples.
- *Solid State Physics* — Neil W. Ashcroft & N. David Mermin. Provides rigorous treatments of lattice geometry and reciprocal lattices.

## Symmetry & Group Theory
- *Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics* — Michael Tinkham. Applies point-group and space-group symmetry to electronic and vibrational problems.
- *Crystallography and Crystal Defects* — Anthony Kelly & Kevin Knowles. Introduces symmetry elements alongside real crystal imperfections.

## Visualization & Databases
- *International Tables for Crystallography, Volume A*. Authoritative listings of space groups, symmetry operations, and standard settings.
- *Crystal Structure Analysis: A Primer* — Jenny P. Glusker, Mitchell Lewis & Miriam Rossi. Guides readers through interpreting diffraction data into lattice symmetries.
