# O1 Effective Mass & Mobility — Book Suggestions

Carrier effective mass and mobility determine transport in crystals, so these books connect band curvature with scattering limits and measurement techniques.

## Band-Structure Foundations
- *Semiconductor Physics and Devices* — Donald A. Neamen. Introduces effective mass from band curvature and connects it to drift velocity in semiconductors.
- *Solid State Electronic Devices* — Ben G. Streetman & Sanjay Banerjee. Provides intuitive derivations of conductivity and mobility for electrons and holes in common materials.

## Transport Theory
- *Electrons and Phonons* — J. M. Ziman. Develops Boltzmann transport equations, relaxation times, and mobility formulas grounded in scattering mechanisms.
- *Solid State Physics* — Ashcroft & Mermin. Offers tensor formulations of effective mass and discusses cyclotron resonance and Hall measurements.

## Experimental & Computational Techniques
- *Semiconductor Material and Device Characterization* — Dieter K. Schroder. Describes Hall effect, time-of-flight, and magneto-transport setups used to extract mobility and effective mass.
- *Boltzmann Transport and Relaxation Time Approaches in Solid State Physics* — Davide Fanelli & Luigi Barletti. Covers numerical extraction of transport coefficients from first-principles band structures.
