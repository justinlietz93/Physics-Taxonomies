# C2 Electron Dynamics in Periodic Media — Book Suggestions

Electrons in periodic potentials develop band structures, effective masses, and transport quirks. These references bridge Bloch theory with practical carrier dynamics.

## Core Band Theory
- *Electronic Properties of Crystalline Solids* — Richard M. Martin. Derives Bloch states, band curvature, and velocity expectations with computational context.
- *Solid State Physics* — Ashcroft & Mermin. Classic treatment of band formation, effective mass, and electron dynamics.

## Transport & Semiconductors
- *Semiconductor Physics and Devices* — Donald A. Neamen. Connects band diagrams to drift, diffusion, and mobility in real devices.
- *Quantum Theory of the Solid State* — Lev Kantorovich. Presents semiclassical electron dynamics and Berry-phase corrections in periodic lattices.

## Advanced Perspectives
- *Spin-Orbitronics and Topological Properties of Nanostructures* — Igor Zutic & Jaroslav Fabian. Explores how periodic potentials with spin interactions reshape electron motion.
- *Wannier Functions and Their Applications* — Nicola Marzari, Andrea Ferretti & Didier Vanderbilt. Details localized representations that support dynamics simulations and tight-binding fits.
