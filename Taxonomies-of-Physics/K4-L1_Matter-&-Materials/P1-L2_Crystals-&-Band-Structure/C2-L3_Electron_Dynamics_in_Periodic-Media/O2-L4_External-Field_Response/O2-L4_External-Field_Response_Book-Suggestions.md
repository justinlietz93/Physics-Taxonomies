# O2 External Field Response — Book Suggestions

This list covers how periodic media respond to electric, magnetic, and optical driving, focusing on transport tensors, magnetoresponse, and nonlinear effects.

## Linear Response Foundations
- *Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid* — Gabriele Giuliani & Giovanni Vignale. Provides Kubo-formalism derivations for conductivity, susceptibility, and dielectric tensors in crystals.
- *Electrodynamics of Solids* — Martin Dressel & George Grüner. Bridges microscopic response functions with measurable transport coefficients across frequencies.

## Magneto-Transport & Quantum Oscillations
- *Magnetic Oscillations in Metals* — D. Shoenberg. Details de Haas–van Alphen and Shubnikov–de Haas techniques that reveal Fermi surfaces and effective masses under magnetic fields.
- *Principles of the Theory of Solids* — J. M. Ziman. Explains magnetoresistance, Hall effect, and thermoelectric responses from semiclassical equations of motion.

## Nonlinear & Optical Response
- *Nonlinear Optics* — Robert W. Boyd. Shows how crystal symmetry and band structure dictate second- and third-order susceptibilities.
- *Modern Theory of Polarization* — Raffaele Resta. Connects Berry-phase treatments of polarization and dielectric response with finite-field calculations.
