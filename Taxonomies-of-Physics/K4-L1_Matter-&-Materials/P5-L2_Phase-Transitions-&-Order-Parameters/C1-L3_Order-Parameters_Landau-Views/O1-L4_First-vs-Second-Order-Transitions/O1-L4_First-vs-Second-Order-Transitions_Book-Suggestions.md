# O1 First vs Second Order Transitions — Book Suggestions

These readings explain the thermodynamic signatures distinguishing first-order and continuous phase transitions through Landau theory and experiments.

## Landau & Thermodynamics Foundations
- *Statistical Physics* — Landau & Lifshitz. Derives Landau free-energy expansions and criteria for first- vs. second-order behavior.
- *Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena* — H. E. Stanley. Provides thermodynamic and statistical descriptions of discontinuous vs. continuous transitions.

## Experimental Signatures
- *Principles of Phase Transitions in Materials* — Alain P. Saxena. Discusses latent heat, hysteresis, and order-parameter behavior across transition types.
- *Thermal Physics of Materials* — Robert Tilley. Links calorimetry, magnetization, and dielectric measurements to transition classification.

## Advanced Perspectives
- *Modern Theory of Critical Phenomena* — Shang-Keng Ma. Explores renormalization-group insights for continuous transitions.
- *Disorder-Induced Phase Transitions* — Imry & Wortis (collected works). Examines how impurities round or broaden first-order transitions.
