# O2 Critical Point Behavior — Book Suggestions

These texts focus on scaling, universality, and fluctuation phenomena near continuous phase transitions.

## Scaling & Universality
- *Introduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena* — H. Eugene Stanley. Introduces scaling laws, critical exponents, and universality classes.
- *Scaling and Renormalization in Statistical Physics* — John Cardy. Provides renormalization-group derivations of critical behavior.

## Experimental Probes
- *Critical Phenomena in Natural Sciences* — Didier Sornette. Surveys experiments across magnets, fluids, and superconductors demonstrating critical scaling.
- *Critical Phenomena in Fluids* — M. E. Fisher & B. Widom (reviews). Discusses light scattering, heat capacity, and transport anomalies near critical points.

## Advanced Topics
- *Renormalization Group* — L. P. Kadanoff. Explains fixed points and crossover phenomena in critical systems.
- *Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena* (Vol. 3) — Domb & Green (eds.). Collects detailed treatments of critical dynamics and fluctuation effects.
