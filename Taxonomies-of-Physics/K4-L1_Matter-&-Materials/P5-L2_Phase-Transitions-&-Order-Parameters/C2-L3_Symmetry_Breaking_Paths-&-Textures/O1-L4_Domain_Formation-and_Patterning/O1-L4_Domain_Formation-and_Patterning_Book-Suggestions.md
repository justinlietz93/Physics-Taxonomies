# O1 Domain Formation & Patterning — Book Suggestions

These references cover how competing interactions produce domains, textures, and pattern formation after symmetry breaking.

## Theory of Domains
- *Principles of Ferroelectrics and Ferroelectricity* — Jona & Shirane. Explains domain formation, wall energetics, and switching pathways in ferroelectrics.
- *Magnetic Domains* — Alex Hubert & Rudolf Schäfer. Comprehensive treatment of domain theory, wall structures, and magnetization processes.

## Pattern Formation & Textures
- *Pattern Formation and Dynamics in Nonequilibrium Systems* — Michael Cross & Henry Greenside. Provides dynamical-systems perspectives on domain patterns and instabilities.
- *Liquid Crystals* — S. Chandrasekhar. Discusses director textures, defects, and field-controlled domain structures in anisotropic fluids.

## Characterization & Control
- *Scanning Probe Microscopy of Functional Materials* — Kalinin & Gruverman (eds.). Presents imaging techniques for domain mapping and nanoscale patterning.
- *Domain Walls in Ferroic Materials* — Dragan Damjanovic (ed.). Covers domain wall engineering, pinning, and device applications across ferroic systems.
