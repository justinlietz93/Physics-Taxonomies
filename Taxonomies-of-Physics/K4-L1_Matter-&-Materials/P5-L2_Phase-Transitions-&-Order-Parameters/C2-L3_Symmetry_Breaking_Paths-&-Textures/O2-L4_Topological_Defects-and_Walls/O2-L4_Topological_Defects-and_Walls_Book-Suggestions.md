# O2 Topological Defects & Walls — Book Suggestions

These books examine vortices, disclinations, skyrmions, and domain walls emerging from broken symmetry and topology.

## Topological Foundations
- *Topology and Geometry for Physicists* — Charles Nash & Siddhartha Sen. Provides homotopy tools for classifying defects in ordered media.
- *Field Theories of Condensed Matter Physics* — Eduardo Fradkin. Connects order-parameter manifolds with topological excitations and effective field theories.

## Specific Defect Types
- *Defects in Liquid Crystals* — Oleg D. Lavrentovich & Ivan I. Smalyukh (chapters in reference works). Covers disclination classification and textures.
- *Skyrmions in Magnetic Materials* — J. Zang & V. Cros (eds.). Explores stabilization, dynamics, and manipulation of magnetic skyrmions and chiral domain walls.

## Experimental & Computational Methods
- *Topological Insulators and Superconductors* — B. Andrei Bernevig & Taylor L. Hughes. Discusses edge states and vortices in topological superconductors.
- *Micromagnetics and Recording Materials* — Aharoni. Provides numerical methods for simulating topological textures and domain wall motion.
