# C2 Symmetry Breaking Paths & Textures — Book Suggestions

Real materials explore multiple symmetry-breaking pathways, leaving behind domains, vortices, and textures. These sources highlight topological defects, coarsening, and pattern formation after transitions.

## Topological Defects
- *Topological Defects and the Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Symmetry Breaking* — Yuriy M. Bunkov & Henri Godfrin (eds.). Discusses vortices, monopoles, and domain walls across condensed matter systems.
- *Defects and Geometry in Condensed Matter Physics* — David Nelson. Relates elastic distortions and curvature to defect textures in crystals and liquid crystals.

## Dynamics & Coarsening
- *Pattern Formation and Dynamics in Nonequilibrium Systems* — Michael Cross & Henry Greenside. Provides models for domain growth and texture evolution following symmetry breaking.
- *Kinetics of Phase Transitions* — Sanjay Puri & V.K. Wadhawan. Covers coarsening laws, scaling, and defect annihilation kinetics.

## Experimental Case Studies
- *Textures and Microstructures in Liquid Crystals* — Özgür Özdamar & Satyendra Kumar (eds.). Presents imaging and control of defect textures in liquid-crystal devices.
- *Superfluid Vortices: Structure and Dynamics* — Russell J. Donnelly. Explores quantized vortices and their role as symmetry-breaking remnants in superfluids.
