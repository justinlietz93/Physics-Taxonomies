# K4–L1 Matter & Materials
**Definition:** Explores how atoms arrange into solids, liquids, and beyond, and how those patterns shape everyday material behavior.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phyla (L2) — index
- P1-L2_Crystals-&-Band-Structure — repeating lattice order sets electronic and optical behavior.
- P2-L2_Lattice-Vibrations-&-Phonons — shared vibrations move heat and sound through solids.
- P3-L2_Defects-Plasticity-&-Fracture — misplaced atoms explain yielding, hardening, and breaking.
- P4-L2_Soft-Matter-&-Rheology — squishy, flowy materials balance elasticity with viscosity.
- P5-L2_Phase-Transitions-&-Order-Parameters — material states switch as order grows or melts away.
- P6-L2_Topological-&-Exotic-Phases — edge-protected behaviors and robust patterns resist disruption.

## Native questions
- How do atomic packing patterns translate into stiffness, conductivity, or brittleness we feel?
- What features mark the moment a material flows, cracks, or transforms into a new phase?

## Everyday anchors
- Table salt crystals, guitar strings, jelly desserts, and smartphone chips all showcase matter organization.
- Kitchen ovens, metal tools, and playground slime reveal how structure guides material responses.
