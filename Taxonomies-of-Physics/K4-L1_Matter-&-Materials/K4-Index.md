# Matter & Materials (how stuff organizes)

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phylum

- **Crystals & Band Structure** — periodic order, electrons in lattices; *salt, chips*.
- **Lattice Vibrations (Phonons)** — sound in solids, heat capacity; *thermal conductivity*.
- **Defects, Plasticity & Fracture** — how materials yield/break; *paper clips, glass*.
- **Soft Matter & Rheology** — gels, polymers, grains; *ketchup, oobleck*.
- **Phase Transitions & Order Parameters** — solid/liquid/gas, magnetism; *freezing water*.
- **Topological & Exotic Phases** — protected edge behavior; *quantum Hall hints*.
