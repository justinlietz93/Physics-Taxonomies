# C1 Viscoelastic Response & Flows — Book Suggestions

Soft materials blend solid-like elasticity with fluid-like flow. These references introduce constitutive models and experiments that reveal viscoelastic signatures.

## Fundamentals of Rheology
- *Dynamics of Polymeric Liquids* — R.B. Bird, R.C. Armstrong & O. Hassager. Offers constitutive models and experimental interpretation for polymer solutions and melts.
- *An Introduction to Rheology* — Howard A. Barnes, John F. Hutton & Kenneth Walters. Provides practical guidance on measuring viscoelastic properties.

## Constitutive Modeling
- *The Structure and Rheology of Complex Fluids* — Ronald G. Larson. Connects microstructure evolution to non-Newtonian stress responses.
- *Viscoelasticity: Phenomenological Aspects* — M. Grmela & H.C. Öttinger. Presents thermodynamically consistent frameworks for viscoelastic constitutive equations.

## Experimental Techniques
- *Techniques in Rheological Measurement* — A.A. Collyer & D.W. Clegg. Surveys oscillatory, creep, and stress relaxation experiments.
- *Microrheology* — Kasper M. Rehfeldt & Andreas Janshoff (eds.). Introduces particle-tracking and optical methods to probe viscoelastic behavior at small scales.
