# O1 Linear Viscoelastic Models — Book Suggestions

These texts build linear viscoelastic constitutive models, relaxation spectra, and experimental interpretations for polymers and soft materials.

## Foundations of Linear Viscoelasticity
- *Introduction to Polymer Viscoelasticity* — Montgomery T. Shaw & William J. MacKnight. Derives standard linear solid, Maxwell, and Kelvin–Voigt models with experimental context.
- *Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers* — John D. Ferry. Classic reference covering relaxation spectra, time–temperature superposition, and linear response functions.

## Mathematical Frameworks
- *Linear Viscoelasticity* — Y. C. Fung. Provides integral formulations, creep–compliance, and relaxation modulus relationships for engineering analysis.
- *The Structure and Rheology of Complex Fluids* — Ronald G. Larson. Connects molecular mechanisms to linear viscoelastic response functions.

## Experimental Interpretation
- *Dynamic Mechanical Analysis* — Kevin P. Menard. Guides DMA experiments and data reduction to extract storage and loss moduli.
- *Rheometry: Industrial Applications* — John Mewis & Jan M. Dealy. Explains how oscillatory shear tests map onto linear viscoelastic models in practice.
