# O2 Non-Newtonian Flows — Book Suggestions

These references explore shear-dependent viscosity, yield stress, and time-dependent behaviors in complex fluids.

## Constitutive Modeling
- *Non-Newtonian Flow and Applied Rheology* — Robert G. Owens & Tim N. Phillips. Presents constitutive equations for shear-thinning, shear-thickening, and viscoelastic fluids.
- *Rheology: Principles, Measurements, and Applications* — Christopher W. Macosko. Covers measurement techniques and model selection for non-Newtonian behavior.

## Yield Stress & Thixotropy
- *Colloidal Suspension Rheology* — Jan Mewis & Norbert J. Wagner. Discusses microstructure evolution, thixotropic loops, and yield-stress models for suspensions.
- *Rheology of Complex Fluids* — R. G. Larson & J. Vermant (eds.). Provides case studies on gels, pastes, and emulsions with time-dependent viscosity.

## Flow Processing Applications
- *Polymer Processing: Principles and Design* — Donald G. Baird & Dimitris I. Collias. Links non-Newtonian constitutive models to extrusion and injection molding flows.
- *An Introduction to Rheology* — H. A. Barnes, J. F. Hutton & K. Walters. Offers practical charts and correlations for engineering flows of non-Newtonian materials.
