# C2 Microstructure Response & Flow — Book Suggestions

Soft matter rheology depends on how microstructure reorganizes under stress. These references highlight particle suspensions, liquid crystals, and active matter where structure-flow coupling dominates.

## Colloids & Suspensions
- *Colloidal Dispersions* — W.B. Russel, D.A. Saville & W.R. Schowalter. Examines hydrodynamic interactions and structure formation in flowing suspensions.
- *The Rheology of Dispersions* — J.A. Rezzonico & F. Caton. Provides experimental strategies to link microstructural evolution with macroscopic viscosity.

## Liquid Crystals & Polymers
- *The Physics of Liquid Crystals* — P.G. de Gennes & J. Prost. Describes director dynamics, defects, and flow alignment in anisotropic fluids.
- *Polymer Physics* — Michael Rubinstein & Ralph H. Colby. Connects chain entanglements and reptation to stress relaxation under shear.

## Active & Structured Fluids
- *Active Matter and Nonequilibrium Statistical Physics* — Julien Tailleur et al. Surveys self-driven particle models and emergent flows.
- *Soft Condensed Matter Physics in Molecular and Cell Biology* — W.C.K. Poon & David Andelman (eds.). Showcases cytoskeletal and cellular flows where microstructure actively drives motion.
