# O1 Structured Fluids & Suspensions — Book Suggestions

These texts focus on how particle interactions, microstructure, and fields control the rheology of suspensions and structured fluids.

## Microstructure Fundamentals
- *Suspension Mechanics* — Jeffrey F. Morris. Provides theory for hydrodynamic interactions, Brownian motion, and microstructural evolution in suspensions.
- *Colloidal Suspension Rheology* — Jan Mewis & Norbert J. Wagner. Links microstructure to viscoelastic and non-Newtonian response across concentration regimes.

## Field-Responsive Fluids
- *Electrorheological Fluids: Modeling and Mathematical Theory* — Michael Ruzicka et al. Covers particle polarization, chain formation, and field-dependent viscosity.
- *Magnetorheology: Advances and Applications* — Norman M. Wereley (ed.). Summarizes magnetorheological fluid design, constitutive models, and device integration.

## Processing & Applications
- *Smart Fluids: Fundamentals and Applications* — Mehrdad Mahdavian. Discusses flow control, damping, and adaptive systems using structured fluids.
- *Microhydrodynamics: Principles and Selected Applications* — Sangtae Kim & Seppo J. Karrila. Supplies lubrication and many-body hydrodynamics tools for analyzing suspension flows.
