# O2 Polymer & Fiber Networks — Book Suggestions

These resources highlight how polymer chain architecture and fiber connectivity govern mechanical response in gels, elastomers, and biological networks.

## Polymer Network Mechanics
- *Polymer Physics* — Michael Rubinstein & Ralph Colby. Details Gaussian chain statistics, network elasticity, and entanglement effects.
- *Principles of Polymer Engineering* — N. G. McCrum, C. P. Buckley & C. B. Bucknall. Provides engineering-scale treatments of rubber elasticity, crosslink density, and viscoelastic response.

## Fiber and Biopolymer Networks
- *Cells, Gels and the Engines of Life* — Gerald H. Pollack. Discusses cytoskeletal networks and gel mechanics with biological emphasis.
- *Biomaterials: The Intersection of Biology and Materials Science* — J. Temenoff & A. Mikos. Covers mechanical characterization of collagen and fibrin networks.

## Modeling & Design
- *Mechanics of Polymer Systems* — G. Marckmann & E. Verron. Presents continuum models (neo-Hookean, Gent, Arruda–Boyce) for network elasticity.
- *Soft Matter Physics* — Masao Doi. Connects microscopic chain dynamics with macroscopic rheology and network relaxation.
