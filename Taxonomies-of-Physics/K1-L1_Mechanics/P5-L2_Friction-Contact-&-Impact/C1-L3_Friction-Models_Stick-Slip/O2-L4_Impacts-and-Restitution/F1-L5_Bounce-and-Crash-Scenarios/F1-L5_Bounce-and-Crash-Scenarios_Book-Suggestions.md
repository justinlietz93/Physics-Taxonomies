# F1 Bounce and Crash Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Bounce and crash scenarios draw on collision mechanics texts and automotive crash analyses. These references emphasize restitution, impulse transfer, and energy dissipation in practical settings.

## Collision Mechanics Foundations
- *Impact Mechanics* — W.J. Stronge. Provides analytical treatments of restitution, impulse, and energy loss in normal and oblique impacts.
- *Collisions and Contact Sports: A Physicist’s Perspective* — Michael Hertz. Uses everyday bounce examples to explain impact coefficients and safety considerations.

## Automotive Crash Analysis
- *Vehicle Crash Mechanics* — Matthew Huang. Covers crash pulse modeling, occupant deceleration, and restitution-based energy accounting.
- *Crashworthiness of Vehicle Structures* — Jorge A.C. Ambrósio (ed.). Details simulation and testing approaches for crash events, linking to impact energy budgets.

## Experimental Methods
- *Dynamic Impact Testing* — T.A. Pope & W. Johnson. Explains drop-weight testing, high-speed diagnostics, and data reduction for collision experiments.
- *Instrumented Impact Testing* — ASTM International Manuals. Provides standards and measurement protocols for bounce and crash laboratory setups.
