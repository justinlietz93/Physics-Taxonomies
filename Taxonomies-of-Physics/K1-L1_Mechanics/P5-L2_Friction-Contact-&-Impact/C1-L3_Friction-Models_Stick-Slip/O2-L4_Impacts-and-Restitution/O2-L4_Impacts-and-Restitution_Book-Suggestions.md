# O2 Impacts and Restitution — Book Suggestions

Collision studies blend short-duration dynamics with material response. These books provide theoretical, computational, and testing roadmaps for impact analysis.

## Core Impact Theory
- *Impact Dynamics* — Jerry Ginsberg. Develops impulse-momentum formulations, restitution models, and multi-body collision chains with practical derivations.
- *Impact Mechanics* — W. Johnson. Surveys rigid and deformable impact scenarios, emphasizing contact force histories and coefficient-of-restitution behavior.

## Material and Structural Response
- *Dynamics of Mechanical Systems* — Harold Josephs & Ronald Huston. Connects collision loads to flexible body response, providing examples with rotating and translating subsystems.
- *Collision and Impact of Elastic Bodies* — Chao Huang & Tadashi Kishi. Focuses on elastic-plastic wave propagation and material properties that govern rebound performance.

## Testing and Simulation Practice
- *Testing of Metallic and Composite Materials under Dynamic Loading* — V. I. Trefilov et al. Details experimental rigs, instrumentation, and data interpretation for measuring impact behavior.
- *Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms* — Roy Featherstone. Offers computational tools for simulating contact impulses and restitution in articulated mechanical systems.
