# F2 Impact Testing Methods — Book Suggestions

Impact testing guides focus on instrumentation, standards, and data reduction. These references help engineers design repeatable setups and interpret force-time histories.

## Testing Standards and Procedures
- *Instrumented Impact Testing* — ASTM International Manuals. Summarizes standardized methods for Charpy, Izod, and drop-weight impact tests.
- *Dynamic Impact Testing* — T.A. Pope & W. Johnson. Details apparatus design, calibration, and data acquisition for impact experiments.

## Data Analysis and Modeling
- *Impact and Crash Analysis of Composite Structures* — Serge Abrate. Links measured force pulses to material damage models.
- *Mechanical Testing of Advanced Fibre Composites* — J.M. Hodgkinson (ed.). Provides impact energy calculation examples and statistical treatment of test data.

## Sensor Technology References
- *Measurement Systems: Application and Design* — Ernest O. Doebelin & Dhanesh N. Manik. Covers accelerometer, load cell, and signal processing techniques used in impact rigs.
- *Handbook of Measurement in Science and Engineering* — Myer Kutz (ed.). Offers practical guidance on high-rate data capture and uncertainty analysis for impact measurements.
