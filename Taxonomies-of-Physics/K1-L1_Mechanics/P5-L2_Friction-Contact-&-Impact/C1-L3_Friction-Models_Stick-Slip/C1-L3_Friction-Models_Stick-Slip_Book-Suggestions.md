# C1 Friction Models & Stick-Slip — Book Suggestions

Friction marries microscale adhesion with macroscale motion. These books cover constitutive laws, stick-slip instabilities, and experimental techniques for characterizing contact.

## Friction Fundamentals
- *Friction: Science and Technology* — Peter J. Blau. Explores microscopic origins, tribological regimes, and measurement strategies.
- *Engineering Tribology* — Gwidon Stachowiak & Andrew Batchelor. Provides models for dry, lubricated, and boundary friction along with data for design.

## Stick-Slip Dynamics
- *Stick-Slip Phenomena* — Carlo Carbone & Matteo Ciavarella. Focuses on rate-and-state friction, relaxation oscillations, and experimental signatures.
- *Nonlinear Dynamics of Chaotic and Stochastic Systems* — Vadim S. Anishchenko. Places stick-slip oscillations within broader nonlinear dynamics frameworks.

## Applications & Measurement
- *Contact Mechanics* — K. L. Johnson. Analyzes Hertzian contacts, adhesion, and tangential loading relevant to friction models.
- *Atomic Force Microscopy* — Peter Eaton & Paul West. Demonstrates nanoscale force measurements that validate tribological constitutive laws.
