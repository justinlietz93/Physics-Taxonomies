# G1 Push-Pull Thresholds â€” Core Equations

Push and pull tests estimate static friction thresholds for everyday objects. These equations convert measured forces into coefficients, safety factors, and ramp angle requirements.

## Static Friction Force Limit
**Sets the threshold before motion.**

$$F_{\text{max}} = \mu_s N$$

- The maximum horizontal force equals the static friction coefficient $\mu_s$ times normal force $N$, predicting when sliding begins.

## Coefficient Estimate from Force Gauge
**Uses measured pull force and weight.**

$$\mu_s = \frac{F_{\text{gauge}}}{W}$$

- Dividing the recorded threshold force by weight $W$ yields the friction coefficient used in material comparisons.

## Ramp Angle for Impending Slip
**Translates coefficient into critical angle.**

$$\theta_c = \tan^{-1}(\mu_s)$$

- Tilting the surface to angle $\theta_c$ reproduces the same threshold; comparing measured angle and force checks consistency.
