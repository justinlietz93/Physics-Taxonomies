# F1 Block on Surface Cases — Book Suggestions

Introductory friction labs show how static resistance gives way to kinetic sliding for simple block setups. These titles highlight measurement techniques, incline-plane analytics, and classroom experiments that match the family scope.

## Undergraduate Friction Primers
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Derives static and kinetic friction bounds with incline-plane worked examples.
- *Engineering Mechanics: Statics* — J.L. Meriam & L.G. Kraige. Details free-body diagrams and equilibrium checks for block-on-surface problems.

## Laboratory Experiment Guides
- *Physics with Laboratory Work for Engineers* — L.P. Williams. Provides lab procedures for measuring friction coefficients using blocks and tilting tables.
- *Practical Physics* — G.L. Squires. Offers data-reduction strategies and uncertainty analysis for friction experiments.

## Applied Problem Collections
- *Schaum's Outline of Engineering Mechanics Statics* — E.W. Nelson, C.L. Best & W.G. McLean. Supplies targeted problem sets on impending motion and sliding friction.
- *200 Puzzling Physics Problems* — P. Gnädig, G. Honyek & K.F. Riley. Includes conceptual variants of block-and-plane friction puzzles with full solutions.
