# G2 Block on Surface Cases Extension Portfolios â€” Core Equations

Extension studies vary surface treatments and loading conditions. These equations handle kinetic friction, temperature effects, and uncertainty analysis for comparative portfolios.

## Kinetic Friction Force During Motion
**Relates sliding force to kinetic coefficient.**

$$F_k = \mu_k N$$

- After motion begins, the kinetic coefficient $\mu_k$ governs steady sliding forces; comparing $\mu_k$ across surfaces informs material choices.

## Velocity-Dependent Friction Model
**Captures speed-sensitive behavior.**

$$\mu_k(v) = \mu_0 + c v$$

- Empirical linear model approximates how friction increases with speed $v$, supporting experiments on lubricated or roughened surfaces.

## Uncertainty in Coefficient Measurement
**Propagates gauge errors into \(\mu\).**

$$\Delta \mu = \mu \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta F}{F}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta N}{N}\right)^2}$$

- Combining force and normal load uncertainties yields confidence intervals for reported friction coefficients.
