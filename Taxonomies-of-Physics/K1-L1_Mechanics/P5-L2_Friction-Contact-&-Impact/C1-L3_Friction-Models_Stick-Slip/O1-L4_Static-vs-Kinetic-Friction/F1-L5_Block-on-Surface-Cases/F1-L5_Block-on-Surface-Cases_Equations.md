# F1 Block on Surface Cases â€” Core Equations

Everyday block-and-surface setups hinge on the balance between static grip and kinetic drag. These expressions capture the thresholds and resulting motions once slipping begins.

## Static Friction Balance
**No-slip condition:**

$$|F_{\text{applied}}| \leq \mu_{s} N$$

- The applied tangential force must stay below the static friction limit set by coefficient $\mu_{s}$ and normal load $N = mg\cos\theta$ to keep the block at rest.

## Impending Motion Threshold
**Maximum static friction:**

$$F_{\text{max}}^{(s)} = \mu_{s} N = \mu_{s} mg \cos\theta$$

- Solving for the incline angle or push magnitude that triggers slip sets the tipping point between sticking and sliding regimes.

## Kinetic Friction Acceleration
**Sliding dynamics:**

$$a = g \left(\sin\theta - \mu_{k} \cos\theta\right)$$

- Once motion starts, the block accelerates (or decelerates) according to the net downhill component minus kinetic friction with coefficient $\mu_{k}$.
