# O1 Static vs Kinetic Friction — Book Suggestions

Practical tribology mixes surface science, materials, and force balance heuristics. These titles walk learners from first-contact intuition to engineering-scale design tools.

## Introductory Tribology Guides
- *Engineering Tribology* — Gwidon W. Stachowiak & Andrew W. Batchelor. Comprehensive treatment of friction regimes, contact mechanics, and lubrication fundamentals with clear comparisons between static and kinetic limits.
- *Friction Science and Technology* — Peter J. Blau. Explains empirical friction laws, surface interactions, and measurement techniques that validate Coulomb models in real assemblies.

## Materials and Surface Engineering References
- *Introduction to Contact Mechanics* — Po Cheng & Bo Li. Builds the elastic and plastic contact theory needed to predict normal forces and friction coefficients for varied materials.
- *Surface Engineering for Corrosion and Wear Resistance* — J. R. Davis. Links coatings and treatments to friction behavior, showing how engineered surfaces shift static versus kinetic thresholds.

## Laboratory and Design Manuals
- *Tribology Data Handbook* — E. Richard Booser. Collates friction coefficients, wear rates, and experimental setups to benchmark models and choose materials under specific loads.
- *Practical Guide to Surface Metrology* — David J. Whitehouse. Demonstrates how roughness measurements correlate with sticking or sliding behavior in design validation.
