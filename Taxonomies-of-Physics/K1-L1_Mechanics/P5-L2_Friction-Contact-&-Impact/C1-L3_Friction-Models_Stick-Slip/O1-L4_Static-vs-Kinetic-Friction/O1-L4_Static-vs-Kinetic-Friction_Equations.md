# O1 Static vs Kinetic Friction â€” Core Equations

Interfaces grip until tangential forces exceed a threshold, then slide with steady resistance. These relations quantify the force balance, slip onset, and energy loss for dry contact pairs.

## Force Limits at Rest
**Static friction inequality:**

$$|F_{\mathrm{s}}| \leq \mu_{\mathrm{s}} N$$

- The static friction force $F_{\mathrm{s}}$ adjusts up to a maximum set by the coefficient $\mu_{\mathrm{s}}$ times the normal load $N$, keeping bodies locked together while $|F_{\mathrm{applied}}| < \mu_{\mathrm{s}}N$.

**Peak stick condition:**

$$|F_{\mathrm{applied}}| = \mu_{\mathrm{s}} N \Rightarrow \text{impending motion}$$

- Equality marks the tipping point: any further tangential push overcomes the static capacity and initiates sliding.

## Kinetic Sliding Response
**Constant kinetic friction:**

$$F_{\mathrm{k}} = -\mu_{\mathrm{k}} N\, \operatorname{sgn}(v_{\mathrm{rel}})$$

- Once in motion, the resisting force takes a nearly constant magnitude set by the kinetic coefficient $\mu_{\mathrm{k}}$ and opposes the relative slip velocity $v_{\mathrm{rel}}$.

**Net force during slide:**

$$m a = F_{\mathrm{drive}} + F_{\mathrm{k}}$$

- The kinetic friction term subtracts from any driving input $F_{\mathrm{drive}}$, reducing acceleration $a$ compared with the frictionless case.

## Energy Dissipation
**Work done by kinetic friction:**

$$W_{\mathrm{fric}} = -\mu_{\mathrm{k}} N \, \Delta s$$

- Sliding through a distance $\Delta s$ converts mechanical energy into heat in proportion to the normal load and kinetic coefficient.

**Power loss in steady sliding:**

$$P_{\mathrm{loss}} = \mu_{\mathrm{k}} N \, v_{\mathrm{rel}}$$

- During constant-speed motion, the rate of energy dissipation scales with both the slip speed and the sustained contact pressure.
