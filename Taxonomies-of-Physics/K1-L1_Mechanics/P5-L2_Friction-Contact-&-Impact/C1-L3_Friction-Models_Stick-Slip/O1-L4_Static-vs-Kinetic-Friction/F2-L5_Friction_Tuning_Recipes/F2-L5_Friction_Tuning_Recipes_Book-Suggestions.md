# F2 Friction Tuning Recipes — Book Suggestions

Friction tuning recipes draw on tribology handbooks and surface engineering guides. These resources emphasize how to dial traction up or down with coatings, load control, or lubrication regimes.

## Tribology Fundamentals
- *Engineering Tribology* — Gwidon W. Stachowiak & Andrew W. Batchelor. Explains Stribeck curves, adhesion models, and surface texturing for friction control.
- *Tribology: Friction and Wear of Engineering Materials* — I.M. Hutchings & P. Shipway. Details how normal load, temperature, and surface conditioning change friction coefficients.

## Surface Treatments and Coatings
- *Surface Engineering for Corrosion and Wear Resistance* — J.R. Davis (ed.). Surveys coatings and surface treatments that tune stick-slip thresholds in machinery and tooling.
- *Friction Science and Technology* — Peter J. Blau. Connects microstructure, contact mechanics, and lubrication choices to measurable friction changes.

## Application Playbooks
- *Handbook of Lubrication and Tribology, Volume I* — Robert W. Bruce (ed.). Provides practical design charts for selecting lubricants and additives to reach target friction levels.
- *Adhesion Science and Engineering* — D.A. Dillard & A.V. Pocius (eds.). Covers adhesive-friction coupling and how to engineer contact interfaces in robotics and manufacturing.
