# P5 Friction, Contact & Impact — Book Suggestions

These books focus on surface interactions, wear, and collision phenomena across mechanical systems.

## Friction & Tribology
- *Engineering Tribology* — Gwidon Stachowiak & Andrew Batchelor. Comprehensive treatment of friction, lubrication regimes, and surface characterization.
- *Fundamentals of Friction and Wear on the Nanoscale* — Enrico Gnecco & Ernst Meyer. Extends tribological concepts to micro- and nano-scale contacts relevant for precision mechanics.

## Contact Mechanics
- *Contact Mechanics* — K.L. Johnson. Classic reference on elastic contact, Hertz theory, and plastic deformation thresholds.
- *Advanced Contact Mechanics* — Vladislav Popov. Covers numerical methods, rough surfaces, and viscoelastic effects that inform engineering design.

## Impact & Collision Modeling
- *Impact Dynamics* — Jerry Halliday. Discusses rigid-body impacts, coefficient of restitution, and energy transfer in mechanical assemblies.
- *Granular Gases* — Thorsten Pöschel & Nikolai Brilliantov. Explores dissipative collisions and kinetic descriptions for particulate media.
