# C2 Collision Energy Management — Book Suggestions

Collision energy management balances impact forces, deformation, and energy absorption. These references blend mechanics, materials, and design strategies for controlling impact outcomes.

## Impact Mechanics
- *Impact Dynamics* — J. A. C. S. Daniels & A. T. Chai. Explains impact force histories, contact durations, and energy partitioning in structures.
- *Impact: The Theory and Physical Behaviour of Colliding Solids* — Werner Goldsmith. Classic treatment of elastic and plastic impacts with analytical and experimental benchmarks.

## Energy Absorption
- *Energy Absorption of Structures and Materials* — A. G. Mamalis & D. E. Manolakos. Covers crumple zones, foams, and composite absorbers for impact mitigation.
- *Crashworthiness of Vehicles* — Johan Strandroth et al.. Applies collision mechanics to automotive safety design and regulation.

## Measurement & Simulation
- *Finite Element Procedures* — Klaus-Jürgen Bathe. Shows how explicit dynamics solvers capture impact deformation and energy flow.
- *Experimental Methods in Impact Mechanics* — Jack A. Collins. Details instrumentation, high-speed imaging, and data analysis for collision testing.
