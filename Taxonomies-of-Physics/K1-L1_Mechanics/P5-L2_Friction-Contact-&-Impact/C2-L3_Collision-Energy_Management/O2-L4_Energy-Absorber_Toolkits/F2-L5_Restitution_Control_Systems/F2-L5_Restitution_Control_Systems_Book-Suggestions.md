# F2 Restitution Control Systems — Book Suggestions

Restitution control systems reference vibration isolation, bumper design, and compliant mechanism literature. These sources explain how to choose damping and spring elements that deliver target rebound.

## Vibration and Shock Isolation
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Derives damping ratios, transmissibility, and impact responses for spring–dashpot systems.
- *Shock and Vibration Handbook* — Cyril M. Harris & Allan G. Piersol (eds.). Provides design tables for impact attenuation and rebound control.

## Automotive and Aerospace Applications
- *Automotive Bumpers* — Wolfgang Reimpell & Helmut Stoll. Discusses energy absorbers, restitution tuning, and compliance strategies in vehicle bumpers.
- *Landing Gear Design Handbook* — Norman S. Currey. Explains oleo-pneumatic struts and damping adjustments that govern aircraft touchdown rebound.

## Compliant and Soft Robotics Interfaces
- *Soft Robotics: Trends, Applications and Challenges* — Cecilia Laschi & Matteo Cianchetti (eds.). Covers compliance control and tunable damping in robot grippers and manipulators.
- *Design of Compliant Mechanisms* — Nicolae Lobontiu. Provides analytical tools for tailoring stiffness and damping in compliant contacts to manage restitution.
