# F1 Dissipation Materials Catalogs — Book Suggestions

Cataloging dissipation materials leans on references that compare foams, honeycombs, and viscoelastic pads. These books supply property charts and selection criteria for impact mitigation.

## Cellular Solids and Foams
- *Cellular Solids: Structure and Properties* — Lorna J. Gibson & Michael F. Ashby. Provides scaling laws and property maps for energy-absorbing foams and honeycombs.
- *Crashworthy Energy-Absorbing Structures* — Sergey M. Lozhechnikov (ed.). Surveys foam, honeycomb, and metallic crush elements used in transportation safety.

## Viscoelastic and Polymer Dampers
- *Engineering with Rubber* — Alan N. Gent (ed.). Discusses loss factors, modulus tuning, and material selection for elastomeric impact pads.
- *Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers* — John D. Ferry. Presents frequency-dependent damping characteristics for polymer-based dissipators.

## Material Selection Handbooks
- *Materials Selection in Mechanical Design* — Michael F. Ashby. Offers Ashby charts and selection strategies to balance mass, stiffness, and energy absorption.
- *Handbook of Materials for Product Design* — Charles Harper. Compiles vendor data on crushable cores, gels, and composites suited for dissipation catalogs.
