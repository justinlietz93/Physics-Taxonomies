- *Crashworthiness* — John M. W. Bayne & Masahiro Matsui. Reviews energy management strategies for vehicles, barriers, and industrial equipment with practical design charts.

## Material-Specific Approaches
- *Lightweight Structures in Crashworthiness* — Vistasp Karbhari & Shankar Mall. Focuses on composite and lightweight metallic absorbers, highlighting tailoring of crush modes and SEA.
- *Metal Forming for Crash Components* — Georg Neugebauer. Details forming processes that influence crush performance of aluminum and high-strength steel absorbers.

## Testing and Optimization Manuals
- *Energy Absorbing Materials and Design* — N. Jones & T. Wierzbicki. Provides analytical tools and experimental data for evaluating absorber concepts across load rates.
- *Design and Analysis of Protective Structures* — Zhengqing Chen. Covers optimization techniques and simulation workflows for absorbers in civil and defense applications.
