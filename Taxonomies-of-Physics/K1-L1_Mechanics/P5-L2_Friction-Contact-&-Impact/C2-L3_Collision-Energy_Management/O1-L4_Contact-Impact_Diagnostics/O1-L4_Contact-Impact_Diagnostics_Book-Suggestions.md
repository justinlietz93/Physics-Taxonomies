# O1 Contact Impact Diagnostics — Book Suggestions

Reliable diagnostics convert raw impact signals into actionable insight. These references cover sensing hardware, data processing, and forensic techniques for collision events.

## Sensor Deployment and Calibration
- *Experimental Methods for Engineers* — J. P. Holman. Lays out instrumentation strategies, uncertainty analysis, and dynamic signal conditioning applicable to impact rigs.
- *Dynamic Measurements: A Practical Guide* — John P. Bentley. Focuses on accelerometer, load cell, and displacement sensor selection for short-duration events.

## Data Interpretation and Modeling
- *Structural Impact* — Norman Jones. Integrates measured force-displacement histories with analytical models to classify impact severity and structural response.
- *Analysis of Engineering Structures and Material Behavior* — Josip Brnic. Demonstrates how to translate strain and stress data into failure predictions for impact-loaded components.

## Forensic and Safety Applications
- *Accident Reconstruction Research* — Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Compilations. Provides case studies linking sensor data to collision reconstruction in automotive contexts.
- *Crashworthiness Data for Impact Safety* — Matthew Huang. Offers methodologies for interpreting crash test signals and deriving occupant protection metrics.
