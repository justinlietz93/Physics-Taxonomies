# F1 Surface Damage Surveys â€” Core Equations

Surface damage surveys quantify contact pressures and plastic deformation triggered by impacts. These relations estimate when dents, brinelling, or yielding start to appear.

## Hertzian Contact Pressure
**Elastic peak stress:**

$$p_{0} = \left(\frac{6 F E^{*2}}{\pi^{3} R^{2}}\right)^{1/3}$$

- For sphere-on-flat contact, the maximum pressure $p_{0}$ depends on impact force $F$, effective modulus $E^{*}$, and sphere radius $R$, indicating whether stresses exceed material hardness.

## Plastic Yield Criterion
**Onset of yielding:**

$$p_{0} \geq 1.1\,\sigma_{y}$$

- When the peak Hertzian pressure surpasses roughly $1.1$ times the yield strength $\sigma_{y}$, subsurface plastic zones form, signaling permanent surface damage.

## Residual Indentation Depth
**Energy balance estimate:**

$$h \approx \frac{F^{2}}{2 A^{2} E^{*}}$$

- Relating work of indentation to elastic recovery area $A$ provides a first-pass indentation depth $h$, useful for mapping dent severity across survey points.
