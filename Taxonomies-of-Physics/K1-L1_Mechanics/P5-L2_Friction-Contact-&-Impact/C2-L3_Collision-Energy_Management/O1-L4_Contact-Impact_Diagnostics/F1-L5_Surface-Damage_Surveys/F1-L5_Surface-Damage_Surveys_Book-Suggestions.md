# F1 Surface Damage Surveys — Book Suggestions

Surface damage surveys require tools for inspecting contact scars and linking them to stress limits. These sources emphasize wear diagnostics, hardness testing, and Hertzian stress assessment.

## Wear Inspection References
- *Introduction to Tribology* — Bharat Bhushan. Explains surface microscopy, wear scar classification, and Hertzian stress analysis.
- *Practical Guide to Surface Metrology* — David J. Whitehouse. Covers profilometry and roughness parameters used in damage surveys.

## Hardness and Indentation Testing
- *Hardness Testing: Principles and Applications* — A. Vingsbo & S. Hogmark. Details indentation methods for quantifying residual impressions and yield onset.
- *Indentation Techniques in Materials Engineering* — G.M. Pharr & A. Bolshakov. Links load-depth curves to subsurface plasticity indicators.

## Rolling and Impact Contact Failures
- *Rolling Contact Fatigue* — A.A. Torabi. Describes brinelling, pitting, and subsurface damage thresholds in bearings and gears.
- *Failure Analysis of Engineering Structures: Methods and Case Studies* — L.C. Wroblewski. Provides field examples of impact-induced surface damage with diagnostic workflows.
