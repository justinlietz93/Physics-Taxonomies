# F2 Event Reconstruction Stories â€” Core Equations

Reconstructing impact events combines conservation laws with measured evidence. These equations translate skid marks, crush depth, and momentum balance into pre-impact conditions.

## Momentum Conservation in Two Dimensions
**Planar collision solve:**

$$m_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}^{-} + m_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2}^{-} = m_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}^{+} + m_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2}^{+}$$

- Vector momentum conservation relates unknown pre-impact velocities $\mathbf{v}^{-}$ to measured post-impact directions $\mathbf{v}^{+}$ when external impulses are negligible.

## Energy from Crush Depth
**Campbell crush formula:**

$$E_{c} = k_{c} \, \delta^{2}$$

- Accident reconstructions map vehicle crush depth $\delta$ to dissipated energy $E_{c}$ using stiffness coefficient $k_{c}$ derived from crash tests.

## Skid-Based Speed Estimate
**Work-energy link:**

$$v_{\text{pre}} = \sqrt{2 g \mu_{\text{road}} d}$$

- Braking distance $d$ and roadway friction $\mu_{\text{road}}$ give the vehicle speed just before braking, anchoring event timelines.
