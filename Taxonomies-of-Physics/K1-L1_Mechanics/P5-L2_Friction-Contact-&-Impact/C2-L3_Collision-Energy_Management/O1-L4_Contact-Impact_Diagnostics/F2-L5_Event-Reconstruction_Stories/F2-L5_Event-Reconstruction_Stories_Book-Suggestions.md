# F2 Event Reconstruction Stories — Book Suggestions

Event reconstructions synthesize physical evidence, crash testing data, and kinematic calculations. These books guide practitioners through speed estimates, crush-energy mapping, and uncertainty management.

## Accident Reconstruction Fundamentals
- *Traffic Crash Reconstruction* — Lynn B. Fricke. Provides conservation-of-momentum, energy, and work-energy methods tailored to roadway events.
- *Motor Vehicle Accident Reconstruction and Cause Analysis* — Rudolf Limpert. Covers skid-to-stop, momentum, and time-distance tools for collision narratives.

## Crush and Energy Methods
- *Vehicle Crashworthiness and Occupant Protection* — J.D. Reid & J.W. Zellner. Discusses stiffness coefficients, energy absorption, and validation against crash tests.
- *Crash Analysis and Reconstruction* — Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Compilation. Presents case studies linking crush profiles to pre-impact speeds.

## Evidence Handling and Uncertainty
- *Forensic Engineering Fundamentals* — Harold Franck & Darren Franck. Explains data collection, measurement uncertainty, and scenario synthesis for impact cases.
- *Forensic Accident Investigation: A Practical Guide* — Anthony J. Brueski. Walks through evidence mapping, diagramming, and testimony preparation grounded in physics calculations.
