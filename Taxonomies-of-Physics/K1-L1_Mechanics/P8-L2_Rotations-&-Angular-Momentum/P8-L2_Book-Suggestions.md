# P8 Rotations & Angular Momentum — Book Suggestions

These books highlight rigid-body rotation, gyroscopic behavior, and angular momentum transport from foundational treatments to advanced applications.

## Foundational Mechanics
- *Rigid Body Dynamics* — Stephen H. Crandall, Arthur R. Calloway, & Thomas J. Lardner. Systematic derivations of rotational kinematics, inertia, and torque relations.
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Louis N. Hand & Janet D. Finch. Integrates angular momentum, Euler angles, and Hamiltonian perspectives for rotating systems.

## Gyroscopes & Attitude Dynamics
- *Dynamics of Atmospheric Re-Entry* — Frank J. Regan & Satya M. Anandakrishnan. Applies rotational dynamics and stability to spacecraft re-entry guidance.
- *Spacecraft Dynamics and Control: An Introduction* — Marcel J. Sidi. Provides quaternion-based attitude propagation, gyroscopic couplings, and control strategies.

## Advanced Topics & Applications
- *The Dynamics of Spinning Spacecraft* — Robert F. Sissala. Focuses on spin stabilization, nutation damping, and control of high-angular-momentum vehicles.
- *Rotating Fluids in Engineering and Science* — James P. Vanyo. Extends angular momentum concepts to rotating fluids, centrifuges, and geophysical systems.
