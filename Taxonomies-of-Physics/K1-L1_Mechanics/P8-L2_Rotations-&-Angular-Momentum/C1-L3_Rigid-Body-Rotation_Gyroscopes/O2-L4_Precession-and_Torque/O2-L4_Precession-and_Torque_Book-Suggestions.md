# O2 Precession and Torque — Book Suggestions

Gyroscopic precession underlies navigation, control, and stabilization systems. These references bridge foundational theory with aerospace and mechanical applications.

## Gyroscope Theory
- *Gyroscopes: Theory and Design* — V. V. Vasiliev & V. I. Kolesov. Provides detailed derivations of precession dynamics, errors, and mechanical implementations.
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein. Offers rigorous treatment of Euler equations, symmetric tops, and gyroscopic motion in Hamiltonian form.

## Control Moment Gyros and Attitude Control
- *Spacecraft Dynamics and Control: An Introduction* — Marcel J. Sidi. Explains how precessing wheels and control moment gyros steer spacecraft attitude.
- *Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems* — Hanspeter Schaub & John L. Junkins. Covers momentum exchange devices, precession control laws, and stability margins.

## Navigation and Instrumentation
- *Inertial Navigation Systems with Geodetic Applications* — Christopher Jekeli. Links gyroscope behavior to inertial measurement unit design and drift compensation.
- *Strapdown Inertial Navigation Technology* — David Titterton & John Weston. Details precession management and torque balancing inside modern navigation sensors.
