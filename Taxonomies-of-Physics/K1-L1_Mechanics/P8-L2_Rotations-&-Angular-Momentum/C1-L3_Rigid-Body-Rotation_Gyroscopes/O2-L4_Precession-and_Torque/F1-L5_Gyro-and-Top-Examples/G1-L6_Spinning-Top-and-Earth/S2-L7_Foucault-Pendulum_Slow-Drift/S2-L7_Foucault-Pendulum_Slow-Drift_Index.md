# S2-L7_Foucault-Pendulum_Slow-Drift — Species Index
**Definition:** A Foucault pendulum swings in a fixed plane while Earth’s rotation makes the floor seem to turn under it.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- The pendulum keeps its swing plane, so the turning Earth makes the path rotate over the day.
- Markers around the circle topple in sequence, revealing the planet’s rotation through precession.
