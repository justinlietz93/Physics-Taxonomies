# F2 Precision Guidance Cases — Book Suggestions

Precision guidance cases leverage spacecraft attitude control and inertial navigation literature. These books detail control moment gyros, reaction wheels, and momentum management strategies.

## Spacecraft Attitude Control
- *Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control* — James R. Wertz. Covers Euler equations, reaction wheel sizing, and control moment gyro configurations.
- *Fundamentals of Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control* — F. Landis Markley & John L. Crassidis. Provides modern algorithms and hardware considerations for precision pointing.

## Inertial Navigation and Gyros
- *Strapdown Inertial Navigation Technology* — David H. Titterton & John L. Weston. Discusses gyroscope behavior, drift, and momentum exchange devices.
- *Modern Inertial Technology* — Anthony Lawrence. Explores control moment gyros, reaction wheels, and stabilization systems for guidance platforms.

## Mission Operations and Momentum Management
- *Spacecraft Dynamics and Control: An Introduction* — Marcel J. Sidi. Presents momentum management strategies, wheel desaturation, and control law design.
- *Practical Spacecraft Attitude Control* — Chuen-Tsai Sun. Offers case studies of precision pointing and torque allocation in operational spacecraft.
