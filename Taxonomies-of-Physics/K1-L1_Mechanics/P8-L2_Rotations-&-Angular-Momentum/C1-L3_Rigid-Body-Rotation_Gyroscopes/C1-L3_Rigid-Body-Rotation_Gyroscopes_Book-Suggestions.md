# C1 Rigid Body Rotation & Gyroscopes — Book Suggestions

Rigid body rotation ties geometry to angular momentum. These books explore Euler angles, gyroscopic stability, and precession for vehicles and instruments.

## Rotation Fundamentals
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein, Charles Poole & John Safko. Covers Euler angles, inertia tensors, and torque-free motion in detail.
- *Rigid Body Dynamics for Space Applications* — Timothy R. Sandor. Applies rotational kinematics and dynamics to spacecraft and gyros.

## Gyroscope Behavior
- *Gyroscopic Theory, Design, and Instrumentation* — J. F. Eastham. Explains spinning-mass sensors, drift, and stabilization principles.
- *Rotordynamics of Turbomachinery* — John M. Vance, Fouad Zeidan & Brian Murphy. Demonstrates gyroscopic effects in rotating machinery and balancing.

## Control & Applications
- *Space Vehicle Dynamics and Control* — Bong Wie. Integrates gyroscope models with control torques for attitude regulation.
- *Modern Inertial Technology* — Anthony Lawrence. Covers gyroscope instrumentation, calibration, and navigation workflows.
