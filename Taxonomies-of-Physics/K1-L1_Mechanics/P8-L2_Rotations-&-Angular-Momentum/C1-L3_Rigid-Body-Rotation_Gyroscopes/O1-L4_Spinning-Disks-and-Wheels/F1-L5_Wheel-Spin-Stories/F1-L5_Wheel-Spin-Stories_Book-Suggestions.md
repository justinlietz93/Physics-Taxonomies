# F1 Wheel Spin Stories — Book Suggestions

Wheel-spin narratives reference introductory rotation texts and hands-on gyroscope guides. These books explain inertia, spin-up, and energy storage in accessible terms.

## Introductory Rotational Mechanics
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Covers rotational inertia, torque, and energy in everyday contexts.
- *Physics for Scientists and Engineers* — Raymond A. Serway & John W. Jewett. Provides worked problems on spinning disks and wheels.

## Demonstration and Experiment Guides
- *The Amateur Scientist* — C.L. Strong. Features home-built gyroscope and flywheel experiments illustrating angular momentum.
- *Physics Demonstrations: A Sourcebook for Teachers of Physics* — Julien Clinton Sprott. Includes spin-top and flywheel demonstrations with setup instructions.

## Energy Storage and Applications
- *Flywheel Energy Storage* — J.T. Kuroiwa & R. Hebner. Discusses modern flywheel systems and performance metrics based on rotational energy.
- *Fundamentals of Power Electronics* — Robert W. Erickson & Dragan Maksimović. Provides context for flywheel energy buffering within power systems.
