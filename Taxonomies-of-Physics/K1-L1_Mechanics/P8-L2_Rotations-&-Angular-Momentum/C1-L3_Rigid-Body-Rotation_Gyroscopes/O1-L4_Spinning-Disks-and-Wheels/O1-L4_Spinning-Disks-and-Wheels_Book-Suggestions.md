# O1 Spinning Disks and Wheels — Book Suggestions

High-speed rotors underpin energy storage, turbines, and machinery. These references combine rotational dynamics, material limits, and balancing practice.

## Rotor Dynamics Fundamentals
- *Rotor Dynamics* — J. S. Rao. Comprehensive coverage of gyroscopic effects, critical speeds, and balancing strategies for rotating machinery.
- *Dynamics of Rotating Systems* — Giancarlo Genta. Bridges theoretical analysis with engineering design of disks and wheels.

## Materials and Stress Limits
- *Mechanical Design of Machine Elements and Machines* — Jack A. Collins et al. Provides stress analysis tools, including rotating disk design charts and safety considerations.
- *High-Speed Rotating Machinery* — Robert B. Randall. Discusses material selection, thermal effects, and burst containment for spinning components.

## Applications and Case Studies
- *Flywheel Energy Storage* — Amir Al-Khalili & Mehrdad Ehsani. Explores flywheel systems, spin-up control, and integration with power electronics.
- *Steam Turbine Design: A Practical Guide* — Murari Singh. Demonstrates how spinning wheel principles apply to turbine rotors and blade disks.
