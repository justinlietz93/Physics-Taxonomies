# F2 Rotor Balance Clinics — Book Suggestions

Rotor balance clinics use rotating machinery diagnostics and vibration analysis references. These texts cover influence coefficient methods, critical speeds, and corrective balancing.

## Rotordynamics Fundamentals
- *Rotordynamics* — Agnieszka Muszynska. Provides theory for unbalance forces, critical speeds, and balancing strategies.
- *Rotating Machinery Vibration* — Maurice L. Adams Jr. Offers practical diagnostics, trial mass methods, and case studies.

## Maintenance and Field Guides
- *Practical Rotor Dynamics and Balancing* — Fred D. Bently & Charles T. Hatch. Gives step-by-step balancing procedures and data sheets for field technicians.
- *Machinery Vibration: Measurement and Analysis* — Victor Wowk. Discusses vibration instrumentation and troubleshooting for rotor imbalance.

## Condition Monitoring Systems
- *Handbook of Rotordynamics* — Jose Luis Esparza & Wen Jeng Chen (eds.). Covers sensor placement, online monitoring, and balancing in industrial settings.
- *Machinery Condition Monitoring* — Amiya Ranjan Mohanty. Links rotor balancing data to predictive maintenance programs.
