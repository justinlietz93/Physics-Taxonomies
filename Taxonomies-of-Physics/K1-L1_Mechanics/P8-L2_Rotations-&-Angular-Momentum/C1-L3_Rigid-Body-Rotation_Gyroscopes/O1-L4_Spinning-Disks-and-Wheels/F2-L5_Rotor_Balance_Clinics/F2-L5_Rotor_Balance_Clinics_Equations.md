# F2 Rotor Balance Clinics â€” Core Equations

Rotor balancing relies on predicting unbalance forces and critical speeds. These equations help diagnose and correct wobble in spinning machinery.

## Unbalance Force
**Single-plane rotor:**

$$F_{u} = m_{e} r_{e} \omega^{2}$$

- Eccentric mass $m_{e}$ at radius $r_{e}$ produces a centrifugal force that grows with spin rate $\omega$.

## Trial Mass Correction
**Balance mass:**

$$m_{c} = m_{t} \frac{X_{u}}{X_{t}}$$

- The correction mass $m_{c}$ scales with trial mass $m_{t}$ and the ratio of measured vibration responses $X_{u}/X_{t}$ from influence coefficient methods.

## Critical Speed Estimate
**Jeffcott rotor:**

$$\omega_{c} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$

- Stiffness $k$ and rotor mass $m$ set the first critical speed, indicating where resonance-induced vibration peaks must be avoided or crossed quickly.
