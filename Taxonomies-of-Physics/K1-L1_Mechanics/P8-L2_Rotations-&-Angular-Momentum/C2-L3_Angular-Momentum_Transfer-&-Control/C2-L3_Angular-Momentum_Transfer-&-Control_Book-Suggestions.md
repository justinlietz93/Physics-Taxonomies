# C2 Angular Momentum Transfer & Control — Book Suggestions

Angular momentum transfer governs maneuvers, stabilization, and reaction systems. These books blend physics and control design for managing spins and torques.

## Momentum Exchange Devices
- *Spacecraft Dynamics and Control* — Marcel J. Sidi. Discusses reaction wheels, control moment gyros, and momentum management.
- *Control Moment Gyro Technology* — Chongshen Yang. Provides design, saturation management, and steering logic for momentum exchange.

## Control Theory Links
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene F. Franklin, J. David Powell & Abbas Emami-Naeini. Lays out linear control strategies applied to angular momentum systems.
- *Modern Spacecraft Dynamics and Control* — Marshall H. Kaplan. Integrates rigid body dynamics with optimal control for pointing and momentum dumping.

## Applied Case Studies
- *Satellite Control Systems* — B. Wie & D. Bailey. Presents in-orbit momentum management, thruster scheduling, and disturbance rejection.
- *Principles of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation* — Paul D. Groves. Shows how momentum control interacts with navigation sensing and estimation.
