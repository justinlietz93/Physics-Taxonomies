# F1 Geartrain and Belt Networks â€” Core Equations

Gear and belt networks transfer angular momentum between shafts. These equations provide speed ratios, torque scaling, and power flow for coupling stories.

## Gear Ratio Relation
**Angular speed:**

$$\frac{\omega_{out}}{\omega_{in}} = \frac{N_{in}}{N_{out}}$$

- Teeth counts $N$ or pulley diameters set the angular speed ratio between input and output shafts.

## Torque Transfer
**Ideal power conservation:**

$$T_{out} = T_{in} \frac{N_{out}}{N_{in}}$$

- In lossless couplers, torque scales inversely with speed ratio to conserve mechanical power ($P = T \omega$).

## Belt Tension Difference
**Power transmission:**

$$P = (T_{tight} - T_{slack}) v$$

- The difference between tight-side and slack-side tensions times belt speed $v$ equals transmitted power, guiding belt tensioning.
