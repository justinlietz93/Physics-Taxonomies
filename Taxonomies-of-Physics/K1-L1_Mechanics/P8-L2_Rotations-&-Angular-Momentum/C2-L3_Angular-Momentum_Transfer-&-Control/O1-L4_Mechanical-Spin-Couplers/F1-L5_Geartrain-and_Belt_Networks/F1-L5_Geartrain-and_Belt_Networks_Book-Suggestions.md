# F1 Geartrain and Belt Networks — Book Suggestions

Geartrain and belt network references emphasize speed ratios, torque transfer, and efficiency. These books supply design charts and maintenance tips for mechanical couplers.

## Gear Design and Analysis
- *Dudley's Handbook of Practical Gear Design and Manufacture* — Stephen P. Radzevich. Covers gear ratio selection, torque capacity, and lubrication for power transmission.
- *Gear Geometry and Applied Theory* — Faydor L. Litvin & Alfonso Fuentes. Provides deeper analytic tools for gear meshing and efficiency.

## Belt and Chain Drives
- *Design of Machinery* — Robert L. Norton. Discusses belt, chain, and gear drive analysis with worked examples.
- *Mechanical Engineers' Handbook, Volume 1: Materials and Engineering Mechanics* — Myer Kutz (ed.). Includes belt tension calculations and coupling choices.

## Maintenance and Troubleshooting
- *Practical Machinery Vibration Analysis and Predictive Maintenance* — Cornelius Scheffer & Paresh Girdhar. Links vibration signatures to misalignment and belt slip.
- *Maintenance Engineering Handbook* — Keith Mobley (ed.). Provides practical guidance on inspection, tensioning, and lubrication for gear and belt networks.
