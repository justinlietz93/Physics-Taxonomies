# S1-L7_Bicycle_Drivetrain_Torque-Mapping — Species Index
**Definition:** A multi-speed bike drivetrain shows how gears trade pedaling cadence for wheel torque on demand.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Shifting between chainrings and sprockets immediately changes wheel torque, making the angular momentum balance tangible.
- Lubrication and tension adjustments keep efficiency high, highlighting how friction losses creep into coupled rotors.
