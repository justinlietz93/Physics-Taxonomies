# O1 Mechanical Spin Couplers — Book Suggestions

Spin couplers coordinate motion across shafts, wheels, and gear trains. These books detail kinematics, power transmission, and practical design of mechanical couplings.

## Gear and Transmission Design
- *Dudley's Handbook of Practical Gear Design and Manufacture* — Stephen P. Radzevich. Offers gear geometry, strength analysis, and manufacturing guidance.
- *Gears and Gear Drives* — Damir Karačić et al. Provides modern treatment of gear meshing, efficiency, and dynamic behavior in coupled systems.

## Belt, Chain, and Clutch Systems
- *Mechanical Power Transmission Components* — Anthony Sofronas. Covers belts, chains, clutches, and brakes with emphasis on sizing and performance.
- *Clutches and Brakes: Design and Selection* — William C. Orthwein. Focuses on torque transmission, heat dissipation, and engagement dynamics for friction couplers.

## Integrated Machine Design
- *Design of Machinery* — Robert L. Norton. Connects mechanism synthesis with speed ratio planning and power flow in rotating assemblies.
- *Machine Design: An Integrated Approach* — Robert L. Norton. Provides case studies that integrate gears, belts, and clutches into cohesive mechanical systems.
