# F2 Fluid and Magnetic Couplers — Book Suggestions

Fluid and magnetic couplers are featured in power transmission and electric machinery literature. These references explain torque capacity, slip control, and thermal management.

## Fluid Coupling References
- *Fluid Coupling and Hydraulic Torque Converter* — Heinz Heisler. Details viscous shear torque transmission, slip behavior, and cooling requirements.
- *Vehicle and Engine Technology* — Heinz Heisler. Provides automotive case studies for fluid couplings and torque converters.

## Magnetic and Eddy-Current Drives
- *Electromechanical Motion Devices* — Paul Krause, Oleg Wasynczuk & Steven Sudhoff. Covers eddy-current couplers, torque-speed curves, and control strategies.
- *Modern Electric Vehicle Technology* — C.C. Chan & K.T. Chau. Discusses magnetic couplers and regenerative slip control in drive systems.

## Maintenance and Design Guides
- *Mechanical Power Transmission Components* — Robert Mott. Offers selection criteria, heat dissipation, and efficiency estimates for non-contact couplers.
- *Handbook of Electric Motors* — Hamid A. Toliyat & Gerald B. Kliman (eds.). Includes chapters on eddy-current drives and torque control for precision applications.
