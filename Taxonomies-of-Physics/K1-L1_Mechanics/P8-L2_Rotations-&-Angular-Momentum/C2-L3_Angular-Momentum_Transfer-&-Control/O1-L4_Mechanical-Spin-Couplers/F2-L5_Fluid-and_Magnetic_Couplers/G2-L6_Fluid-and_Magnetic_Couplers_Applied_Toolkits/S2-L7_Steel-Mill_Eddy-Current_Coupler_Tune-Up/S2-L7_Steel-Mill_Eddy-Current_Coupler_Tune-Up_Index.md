# S2-L7_Steel-Mill_Eddy-Current_Coupler_Tune-Up — Species Index
**Definition:** A steel mill eddy-current coupler tune-up balances coil currents so roller tables start heavy slabs smoothly.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Current ramp profiles are tuned to avoid slip spikes, tying electromagnetic torque curves to production takt time.
- Infrared scans along the rotor show hotspots, guiding maintenance on coolant flow that preserves coupling efficiency.
