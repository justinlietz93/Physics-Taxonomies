# O2 Attitude Management Systems — Book Suggestions

Attitude management blends control theory, actuators, and mission operations. These books provide foundational knowledge and practical design strategies for reaction-wheel and CMG systems.

## Attitude Dynamics and Control
- *Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control* — James R. Wertz. Classic reference covering attitude kinematics, control laws, and actuator sizing.
- *Spacecraft Dynamics and Control: A Practical Engineering Approach* — Marcel J. Sidi. Offers hands-on design methods for reaction wheel and thruster coordination.

## Control Moment Gyros and Momentum Exchange
- *Control Moment Gyro Technology and Application* — Jiuping Xu et al. Focuses on CMG architectures, singularity management, and control allocation.
- *Advanced Control of Aircraft, Spacecraft and Rockets* — Ashish Tewari. Provides modern control techniques applicable to momentum exchange actuators.

## Operations and Fault Management
- *Spacecraft Operational Fault Management* — NASA Systems Engineering Handbook Sections & Case Studies. Discusses momentum dumping, wheel faults, and safe-mode strategies.
- *Practical Spacecraft Telemetry and Control* — Enrico Lorenzini & Giuseppe Reibaldi. Connects ground operations with onboard attitude management tasks.
