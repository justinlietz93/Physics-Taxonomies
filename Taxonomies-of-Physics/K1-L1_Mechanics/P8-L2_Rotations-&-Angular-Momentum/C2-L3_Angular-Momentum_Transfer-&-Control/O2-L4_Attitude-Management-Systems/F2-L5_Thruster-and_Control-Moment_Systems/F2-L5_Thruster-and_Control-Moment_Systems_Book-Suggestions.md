# F2 Thruster and Control Moment Systems — Book Suggestions

Thruster and control moment systems reference spacecraft propulsion and attitude control texts. These sources explain impulse bits, torque authority, and propellant budgeting.

## Propulsion and Impulse Design
- *Rocket Propulsion Elements* — George P. Sutton & Oscar Biblarz. Covers thruster sizing, specific impulse, and impulse bit calculations for attitude control.
- *Space Propulsion Analysis and Design* — Ronald W. Humble, Gary N. Henry & Wiley J. Larson. Provides detailed examples of thruster placement and momentum dumping.

## Attitude Control Implementation
- *Applied Spacecraft Dynamics and Control* — W.T. Thomson & J.R. Tsiotras. Discusses torque budgeting, thruster control laws, and momentum management.
- *Modern Spacecraft Dynamics and Control* — Marshall H. Kaplan. Bridges propulsion system design with attitude stabilization strategies.

## Mission Operations Case Studies
- *Spacecraft Mission Design* — Charles D. Brown. Includes momentum dump planning and thruster operations for various missions.
- *Satellite Communications Systems Engineering* — Wilbur L. Pritchard et al. Provides operational examples of thruster-based attitude control in GEO satellites.
