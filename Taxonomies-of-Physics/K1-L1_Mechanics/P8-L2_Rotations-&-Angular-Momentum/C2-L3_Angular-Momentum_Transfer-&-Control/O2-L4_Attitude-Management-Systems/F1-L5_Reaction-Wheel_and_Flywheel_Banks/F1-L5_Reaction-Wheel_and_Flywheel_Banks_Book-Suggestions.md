# F1 Reaction Wheel and Flywheel Banks — Book Suggestions

Reaction wheel and flywheel banks rely on spacecraft dynamics texts and energy storage references. These titles cover momentum management and wheel hardware design.

## Spacecraft Control References
- *Space Vehicle Dynamics and Control* — Bong Wie. Explains wheel sizing, control torque generation, and momentum dumping strategies.
- *Spacecraft Dynamics and Control: An Introduction* — Marcel J. Sidi. Provides practical examples of reaction wheel arrays and operational considerations.

## Flywheel Technology
- *Flywheel Energy Storage* — J.T. Kuroiwa & R. Hebner. Discusses high-speed rotors, magnetic bearings, and energy management in flywheel banks.
- *High-Speed Rotating Machinery: Design and Analysis* — Austin Hughes & Bill Drury. Covers rotor dynamics and balancing for flywheel assemblies.

## Mission Operations Guides
- *Satellite Communications Systems Engineering* — Wilbur L. Pritchard et al. Includes sections on momentum management in communication satellites.
- *Spacecraft Operations* — Florian Sellmaier et al. Details on-orbit management of reaction wheel momentum and failure handling.
