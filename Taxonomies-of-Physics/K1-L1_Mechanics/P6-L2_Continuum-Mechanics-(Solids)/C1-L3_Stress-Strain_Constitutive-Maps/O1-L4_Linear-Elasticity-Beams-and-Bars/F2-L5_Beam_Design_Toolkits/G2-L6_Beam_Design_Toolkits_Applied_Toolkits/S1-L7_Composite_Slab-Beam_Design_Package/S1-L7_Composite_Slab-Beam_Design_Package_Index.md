# S1-L7_Composite_Slab-Beam_Design_Package — Species Index
**Definition:** Applied design packet marrying steel beams and concrete slab shear studs for mixed office floors.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Blend beam and slab stiffness, size shear studs, and check vibration to deliver open-plan office spans without bounce.
- Include pour sequence notes so crews know when composite action kicks in and temporary shoring can be stripped.
