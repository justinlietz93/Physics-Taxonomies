# F2 Beam Design Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Beam design toolkits rely on manuals that compile allowable stresses, section properties, and serviceability limits. These references streamline member selection for structural systems.

## Structural Steel References
- *AISC Steel Construction Manual* — American Institute of Steel Construction. Provides section modulus tables, design equations, and deflection limits for steel beams.
- *Design of Steel Structures* — Edwin H. Gaylord Jr., Charles N. Gaylord & James E. Stallmeyer. Walks through LRFD and ASD sizing procedures with worked examples.

## Concrete and Composite Systems
- *Reinforced Concrete: Mechanics and Design* — James K. Wight & James G. MacGregor. Explains moment capacity, deflection control, and shear checks for concrete beams.
- *Composite Structures of Steel and Concrete* — R.P. Johnson. Covers composite beam design charts and stiffness adjustments.

## Practical Design Guides
- *Structural Engineer's Pocket Book* — Fiona Cobb. Summarizes deflection limits, load combinations, and quick sizing formulas for beams.
- *Simplified Engineering for Architects and Builders* — James Ambrose & Patrick Tripeny. Offers rapid calculation procedures and selection tables for common materials.
