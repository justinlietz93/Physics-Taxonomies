# O1 Linear Elasticity Beams and Bars — Book Suggestions

Elastic beam and bar theory underpins structural analysis. These books balance derivations, design examples, and intuition for slender members.

## Foundational Texts
- *Mechanics of Materials* — James M. Gere & Barry J. Goodno. Provides clear derivations of axial, bending, and torsional responses with plentiful worked examples.
- *Engineering Mechanics of Deformable Solids* — David H. Allen. Offers continuum underpinnings while keeping focus on 1D structural elements used in practice.

## Structural Design Handbooks
- *Structural Analysis* — R. C. Hibbeler. Connects beam theory to indeterminate structures, influence lines, and load path interpretation.
- *Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain* — Warren C. Young & Richard G. Budynas. Supplies tables of beam deflections, stress factors, and torsion formulas for quick reference.

## Application-Focused Guides
- *Design of Wood Structures* — Donald E. Breyer et al. Demonstrates how elastic beam relations drive sizing decisions in real building materials.
- *Steel Design* — William T. Segui. Bridges theoretical beam behavior with modern steel code provisions and design aids.
