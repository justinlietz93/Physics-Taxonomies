# F1 Beam Bending Cases — Book Suggestions

Beam bending casework benefits from structural analysis references that emphasize simple-span solutions, superposition, and design charts. These titles align with the family’s practical focus.

## Introductory Beam Theory
- *Mechanics of Materials* — Ferdinand P. Beer, E. Russell Johnston Jr., John T. DeWolf & David F. Mazurek. Covers bending stress, deflection tables, and design examples for common beams.
- *Engineering Mechanics of Deformable Solids* — Richard H. Christensen. Provides derivations of Euler–Bernoulli beam relations with worked applications.

## Structural Design Manuals
- *Steel Design* — William T. Segui. Includes beam selection tables, allowable stress checks, and deflection limits for building members.
- *Wood Handbook: Wood as an Engineering Material* — USDA Forest Products Laboratory. Offers span charts and modulus data for timber beams.

## Worked Problem Compendiums
- *Schaum's Outline of Strength of Materials* — William A. Nash & Merle C. Potter. Presents solved bending problems and superposition exercises.
- *Structural Analysis* — Russell C. Hibbeler. Contains numerous beam examples with shear-moment diagrams and deflection solutions.
