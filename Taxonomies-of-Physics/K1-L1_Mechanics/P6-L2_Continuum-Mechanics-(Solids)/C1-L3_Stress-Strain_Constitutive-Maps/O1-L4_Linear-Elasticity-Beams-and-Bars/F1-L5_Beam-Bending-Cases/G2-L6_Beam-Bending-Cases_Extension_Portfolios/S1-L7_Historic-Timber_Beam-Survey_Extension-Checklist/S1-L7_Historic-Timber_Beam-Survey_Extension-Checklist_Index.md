# S1-L7_Historic-Timber_Beam-Survey_Extension-Checklist — Species Index
**Definition:** Field checklist for extending baseline beam-bending cases to aging timber joists in heritage buildings.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Start with the standard simply supported span equations, then factor in moisture, checks, and notches logged during the site walk.
- Pair deflection sketches with quick stiffness back-calculations to flag members that need reinforcement or load re-routing.
