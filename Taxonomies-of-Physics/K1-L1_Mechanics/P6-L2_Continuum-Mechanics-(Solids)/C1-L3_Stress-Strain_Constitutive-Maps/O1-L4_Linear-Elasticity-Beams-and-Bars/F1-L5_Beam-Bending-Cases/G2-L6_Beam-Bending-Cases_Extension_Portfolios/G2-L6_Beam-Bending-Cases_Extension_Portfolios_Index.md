# G2-L6_Beam-Bending-Cases_Extension_Portfolios — Genus Index
**Definition:** Supplemental case bundles that stretch the base beam-bending playbook to weathered members, retrofits, and special inspection asks.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Historic-Timber_Beam-Survey_Extension-Checklist** — site notebook translating sagging, checks, and notches into adjusted deflection and capacity checks.
- **S2-L7_Retrofitted-Steel_Beam_Load-Rating_Portfolio** — rating package showing how plated or wrapped steel beams regain margin for new live loads.
