# S2-L7_Retrofitted-Steel_Beam_Load-Rating_Portfolio — Species Index
**Definition:** Worked load-rating packet for steel beams strengthened with bolted plates or CFRP wraps.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Start with the original section modulus, then layer on composite action factors from the retrofit details to re-score moment capacity.
- Walk through live load envelopes, weld and bolt checks, and serviceability limits so inspectors can sign off on reopened occupancy.
