# G2 Beam Bending Cases Extension Portfolios â€” Core Equations

Classroom benches and staging platforms face mixed loading beyond the single person at midspan. These formulas extend beam checks to uniform loads, offset points, and built-in supports.

## Uniform Load Deflection
**Tracks sag when weight is spread evenly.**

$$\delta_{\text{mid}} = \frac{5 w L^{4}}{384 E I}$$

- For a simply supported beam under uniform load $w$ (force per length), the deflection grows with $L^{4}$, guiding plank spacing decisions.

## Maximum Moment from Uniform Load
**Sets stress demand for distributed loads.**

$$M_{\text{max}} = \frac{w L^{2}}{8}$$

- Converting to stress via $\sigma = M c / I$ reveals whether shelving or stage decks stay within allowable bending limits.

## Cantilever with End Moment
**Covers overhangs braced at one end.**

$$\theta_{\text{tip}} = \frac{M L}{E I}, \qquad \delta_{\text{tip}} = \frac{M L^{2}}{2 E I}$$

- An applied couple at the free end models signage or light fixtures twisting an overhang, giving slope and deflection for mounting hardware checks.

## Equivalent Spring Stiffness
**Simplifies complex loads to a single support constant.**

$$k_{\text{beam}} = \frac{48 E I}{L^{3}}$$

- Treating the beam as a spring allows quick comparison with cushions or isolators in hybrid supports.
