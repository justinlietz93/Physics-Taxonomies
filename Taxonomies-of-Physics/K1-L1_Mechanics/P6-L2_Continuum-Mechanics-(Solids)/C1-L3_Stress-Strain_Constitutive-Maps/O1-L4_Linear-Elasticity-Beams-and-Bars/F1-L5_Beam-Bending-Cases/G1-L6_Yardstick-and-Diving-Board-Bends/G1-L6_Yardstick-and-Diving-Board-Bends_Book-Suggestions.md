# G1 Yardstick and Diving Board Bends — Book Suggestions

Introductory beam texts with real-world examples help coaches and shop teachers translate elastic theory into safe flexing planks.

## Practical Beam Tutorials
- *Engineering Mechanics of Deformable Solids* — Sanjay Govindjee. Clear derivations and homework on simply supported beams align with backyard board scenarios.
- *Strength of Materials* — Timoshenko & Gere. Classic tables for bending stress and deflection support quick safety checks for hobby structures.

## Design Guides
- *Roark's Formulas for Stress and Strain* — Young & Budynas. Reference charts provide deflection and stress factors for both simply supported and cantilever boards.
- *Structural Wood Design* — Abi Aghayere & Jason Vigil. Connects elastic beam calculations to lumber selection, moisture considerations, and code limits.
