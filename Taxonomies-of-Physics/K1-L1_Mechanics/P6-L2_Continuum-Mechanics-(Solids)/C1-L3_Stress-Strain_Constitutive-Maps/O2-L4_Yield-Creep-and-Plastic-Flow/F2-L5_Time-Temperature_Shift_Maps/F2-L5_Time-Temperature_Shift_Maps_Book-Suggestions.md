# F2 Time-Temperature Shift Maps — Book Suggestions

Time-temperature shift maps are staples of polymer viscoelasticity and creep handbooks. These works detail shift factor fitting and master curve construction.

## Viscoelastic Theory
- *Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers* — John D. Ferry. Provides foundational derivations of WLF and Arrhenius shift factors with extensive data tables.
- *Principles of Polymer Engineering* — N.G. McCrum, C.P. Buckley & C.B. Bucknall. Explains time-temperature superposition and its role in mechanical design.

## Creep and Relaxation Analysis
- *Creep and Relaxation of Nonlinear Viscoelastic Materials* — William N. Findley, James S. Lai & Kasif Onaran. Covers shift-factor methods for metals and polymers under varying loads.
- *Time-Temperature Equivalence in Solid Polymers* — G.P. Johari (ed.). Collects research articles on master curve construction and limitations.

## Data Reduction Guides
- *Polymer Testing* — B. Sivaselvam & G. Kiruthika. Offers laboratory procedures and spreadsheets for generating shift maps from dynamic mechanical analysis.
- *Handbook of Polymer Testing* — Roger Brown (ed.). Provides practical recommendations for DMA, creep testing, and temperature correction.
