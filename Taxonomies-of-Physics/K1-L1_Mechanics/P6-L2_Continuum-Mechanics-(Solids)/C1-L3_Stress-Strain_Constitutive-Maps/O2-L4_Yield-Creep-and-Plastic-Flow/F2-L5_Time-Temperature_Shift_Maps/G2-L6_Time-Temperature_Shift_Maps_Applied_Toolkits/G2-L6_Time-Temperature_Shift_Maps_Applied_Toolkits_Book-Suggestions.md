# G2 Time-Temperature Shift Maps Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

These texts extend master-curve methods into design workflows, blending experimental techniques with numerical implementation.

## Experimental Techniques
- *Time-Temperature Transformation in Polymers* — S. L. Aggarwal. Details combined Arrhenius/WLF fitting and provides lab procedures for climate-controlled creep tests.
- *Creep Testing of Metals and Polymers* — R. W. Evans & B. Wilshire. Offers protocols for stress-modified creep and data reduction into shift factors.

## Modeling & Simulation
- *Constitutive Modeling of Glassy Polymers* — R. A. Schapery. Presents stress- and temperature-dependent shift formulations ready for finite-element coding.
- *Viscoelastic Solids* — R. Christensen. Bridges experimental compliance data to generalized Maxwell models and numerical damping parameters.
