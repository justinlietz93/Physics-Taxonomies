# G1 Time-Temperature Shift Maps Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These resources introduce viscoelastic shift factors with worked examples so teams can extrapolate short lab tests to long service times.

## Fundamentals of Viscoelasticity
- *Introduction to Polymer Viscoelasticity* — Ward & Sweeney. Provides derivations of Arrhenius and WLF relations with classroom-scale experiments.
- *Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers* — Ferry. The classic reference for master curves and time–temperature superposition methods.

## Applied Design Contexts
- *Creep and Fatigue in Polymers* — R. M. Christensen. Links compliance curves to component deflection and failure predictions.
- *Polymer Engineering Science and Viscoelasticity* — Hal F. Brinson & L. Catherine Brinson. Offers practical examples of shift factor use in structural components.
