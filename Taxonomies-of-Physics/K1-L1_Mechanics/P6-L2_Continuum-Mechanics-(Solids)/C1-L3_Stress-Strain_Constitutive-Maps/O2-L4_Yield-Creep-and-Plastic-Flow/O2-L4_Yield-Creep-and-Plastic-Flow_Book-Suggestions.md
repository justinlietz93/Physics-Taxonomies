# O2 Yield Creep and Plastic Flow — Book Suggestions

Understanding inelastic material behavior requires constitutive modeling and experimental validation. These books span yield criteria, time-dependent deformation, and computational implementation.

## Plasticity Fundamentals
- *Plasticity Theory* — Jacob Lubliner. Presents rigorous derivations of yield conditions, flow rules, and hardening models relevant to ductile solids.
- *Introduction to Plasticity for Engineers* — M. Endre Nagy. Provides engineering-focused explanations and examples for yield surfaces and incremental analysis.

## Creep and Time-Dependent Behavior
- *Creep and Fatigue in Polymer Matrix Composites* — Rui Miranda Guedes. Shows how viscoelastic and viscoplastic models apply to long-term deformation.
- *Creep Mechanics* — Arthur P. Boresi & Ken Chong. Covers steady-state and transient creep formulations for metals and high-temperature components.

## Computational Implementation
- *Computational Inelasticity* — J. C. Simo & Thomas J. R. Hughes. Details numerical algorithms for integrating plasticity and viscoplastic constitutive laws within finite element solvers.
- *Material Modeling in ABAQUS* — Sumit Ghosh. Demonstrates practical calibration and simulation workflows for yield, creep, and damage models in engineering software.
