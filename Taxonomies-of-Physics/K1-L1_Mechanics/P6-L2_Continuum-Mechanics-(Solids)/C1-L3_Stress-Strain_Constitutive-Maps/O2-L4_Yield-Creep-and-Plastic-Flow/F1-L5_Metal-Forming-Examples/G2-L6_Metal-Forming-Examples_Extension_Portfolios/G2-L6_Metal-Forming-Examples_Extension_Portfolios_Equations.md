# G2 Metal Forming Examples Extension Portfolios â€” Core Equations

School makerspaces often explore drawing cans, coining tokens, or rolling thin sheets. These formulas expand quick calculations to more involved forming paths.

## True Strain in Drawing Operations
**Captures large plastic stretches.**

$$\varepsilon_{\text{true}} = \ln \left( \frac{A_{0}}{A} \right)$$

- Using initial and current cross-sectional areas captures the continuous thinning that occurs when deep drawing cups or forming wires.

## Maximum Drawing Ratio
**Predicts whether a blank can be drawn without tearing.**

$$\text{LDR}_{\max} \approx 2.0 \left(1 + m\right)$$

- With normal anisotropy $m$, this empirical limit helps decide blank diameter choices for aluminum can experiments.

## Springback Angle in Air Bending
**Estimates elastic rebound after unloading.**

$$\Delta\theta = \frac{M}{E I} \frac{L}{t}$$

- Relating bending moment $M$ to geometry approximates how much a sheet will open after forming so dies can be over-bent appropriately.

## Forming Limit Curve Approximation
**Checks safe strain combinations.**

$$\varepsilon_{2} = -\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_{1} + \varepsilon_{0}$$

- A simplified linear segment of the forming limit diagram provides a quick check against measured major strain $\varepsilon_{1}$ to avoid necking.
