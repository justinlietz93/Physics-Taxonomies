# G1 Paperclip and Can Tests — Book Suggestions

Short lab manuals grounded in everyday metals help mentors connect tactile bending experiments to plasticity theory.

## Introductory Plasticity
- *Mechanical Metallurgy* — George Dieter. Provides clear stress–strain curves, bend tests, and strain-hardening discussions suited to classroom demos.
- *Introduction to the Mechanical Behavior of Steel* — G. E. Dieter & M. C. Chia. Focuses on yield, work hardening, and ductility in low-carbon steels found in paperclips.

## Hands-On Lab Guides
- *Metallurgy Fundamentals* — Daniel Brandt & J. C. Warner. Offers shop-scale experiments on bending and cold working with matching calculations.
- *ASM Metals Handbook, Vol. 8: Mechanical Testing* — ASM International. Includes bend test procedures, data interpretation, and safety considerations for informal labs.
