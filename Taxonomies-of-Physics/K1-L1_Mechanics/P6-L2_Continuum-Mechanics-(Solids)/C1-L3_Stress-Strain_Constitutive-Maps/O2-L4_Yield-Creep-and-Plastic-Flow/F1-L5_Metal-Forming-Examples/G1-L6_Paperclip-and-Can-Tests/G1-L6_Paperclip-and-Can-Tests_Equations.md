# G1 Paperclip and Can Tests — Core Equations

Kitchen-table metal tests reveal how ductile materials yield, harden, and eventually fail. These relations let students translate feel-based experiments into quantitative strain measures.

## Engineering Strain from Bend Radius
**Relates observed curvature to surface stretch.**

$$\varepsilon = \frac{t}{2 R}$$

- With sheet thickness $t$ wrapped around radius $R$, this approximates the outer-fiber strain when bending cans or paperclips.

## Onset of Yielding
**Marks when permanent deformation begins.**

$$\sigma_{y} = E \varepsilon_{y}$$

- Multiplying elastic modulus $E$ by the measured yield strain $\varepsilon_{y}$ estimates yield stress, aligning hand-bend thresholds with data sheets.

## Plastic Work per Unit Volume
**Estimates energy absorbed during bending cycles.**

$$w_{p} = \int_{\varepsilon_{y}}^{\varepsilon_{f}} \sigma(\varepsilon) \, d\varepsilon$$

- Approximating the area under the stress–strain curve up to failure strain $\varepsilon_{f}$ links repeated bending to material fatigue.

## Strain Hardening Law
**Tracks strengthening after initial yielding.**

$$\sigma = K \varepsilon^{n}$$

- Fitting constants $K$ and $n$ to measured force-displacement data explains why bent paperclips stiffen before snapping.
