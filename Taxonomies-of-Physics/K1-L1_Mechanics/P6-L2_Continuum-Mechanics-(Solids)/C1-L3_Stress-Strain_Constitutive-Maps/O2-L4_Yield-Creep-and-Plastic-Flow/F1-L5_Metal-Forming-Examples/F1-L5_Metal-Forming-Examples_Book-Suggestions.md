# F1 Metal Forming Examples — Book Suggestions

Metal forming examples call for references that blend constitutive laws with shop-floor calculations. These texts supply forging, rolling, and extrusion case studies aligned with the family scope.

## Forming Fundamentals
- *Manufacturing Engineering and Technology* — Serope Kalpakjian & Steven Schmid. Introduces flow stress, friction, and power calculations for common forming processes.
- *Metal Forming: Mechanics and Metallurgy* — William F. Hosford & Robert M. Caddell. Provides in-depth analysis of deformation behavior and forming load estimates.

## Process-Specific Guides
- *Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing* — Mikell P. Groover. Covers rolling, drawing, and extrusion examples with worked numerical problems.
- *Forging Handbook* — ASM International. Offers practical formulas and case studies for upset forging, impression dies, and ring rolling.

## Shop Calculations and Design
- *Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook, Volume 2: Forming* — Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Compiles tables, die design tips, and empirical corrections for forming loads.
- *Sheet Metal Forming Processes and Die Design* — Vukota Boljanovic. Focuses on press capacity, draw reductions, and springback control calculations.
