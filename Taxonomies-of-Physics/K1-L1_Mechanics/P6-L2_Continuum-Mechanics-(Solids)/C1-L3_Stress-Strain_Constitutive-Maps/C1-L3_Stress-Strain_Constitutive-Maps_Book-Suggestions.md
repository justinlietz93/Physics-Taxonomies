# C1 Stress-Strain Constitutive Maps — Book Suggestions

Constitutive maps connect stress and strain across elastic, plastic, and viscoelastic regimes. These references span theory, experiments, and data needed for class-level understanding.

## Elastic Foundations
- *Elasticity* — J. R. Barber. Lays out stress-strain relations, strain energy, and boundary-value methods for solids.
- *Theory of Elasticity* — Timoshenko & Goodier. Provides tensor notation, anisotropy treatments, and canonical solutions.

## Inelastic Extensions
- *Plasticity for Structural Engineers* — Wei-Chau Xie. Introduces yield criteria, flow rules, and hardening laws that populate constitutive maps.
- *Viscoelastic Solids* — Roderic Lakes. Explains hereditary integrals, relaxation spectra, and experiments linking stress and strain histories.

## Data & Design Charts
- *Materials Selection in Mechanical Design* — Michael F. Ashby. Uses Ashby charts to visualize modulus, strength, and density trade-offs.
- *Experimental Techniques in Materials and Mechanics* — C. Suryanarayana & M. G. Norton. Details strain measurement, mechanical testing, and data reduction for constitutive mapping.
