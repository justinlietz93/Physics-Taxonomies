# O2 Damage Evolution Tracking — Book Suggestions

Damage tracking requires blending fracture mechanics, structural health monitoring, and reliability engineering. These books provide theoretical depth and applied case studies for progressive failure assessment.

## Damage Mechanics Frameworks
- *Continuum Damage Mechanics* — Jean Lemaitre & Rodney Desmorat. Establishes the mathematical basis for damage variables, evolution laws, and coupling with constitutive models.
- *Damage Mechanics* — George Z. Voyiadjis & Peter I. Kattan. Covers isotropic and anisotropic damage formulations with calibration strategies for metals and composites.

## Fatigue and Fracture Progression
- *Metal Fatigue in Engineering* — Henry O. Fuchs & Richard I. Stephens. Provides cycle counting, crack growth, and life prediction tools essential for monitoring fatigue damage.
- *Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications* — Ted L. Anderson. Gives stress intensity and crack propagation relations used to interpret inspection data.

## Reliability and Prognostics
- *Prognostics and Health Management of Electronics* — Michael G. Pecht. Demonstrates how statistical life models and sensor fusion deliver remaining useful life estimates, transferrable to mechanical systems.
- *Structural Health Monitoring Technologies and Next-Generation Smart Composite Structures* — A. K. Gupta & V. K. Gupta. Highlights data-driven damage evolution tracking in advanced materials and structures.
