# F1 Crack Growth Studies — Book Suggestions

Crack growth studies require fracture mechanics references that link inspection data to stress intensity predictions. These books support life estimation and monitoring plans.

## Fracture Mechanics Foundations
- *Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications* — Ted L. Anderson. Covers stress intensity solutions, Paris law constants, and life integration methods.
- *Elementary Engineering Fracture Mechanics* — D. Broek. Provides intuitive derivations and practical examples for crack growth calculations.

## Fatigue and Life Prediction
- *Metal Fatigue in Engineering* — Ralph I. Stephens et al. Discusses crack initiation, growth laws, and inspection planning for metallic structures.
- *Fatigue of Structures and Materials* — Jaap Schijve. Offers case studies and data for calibrating crack growth models.

## Inspection and Monitoring
- *Damage Tolerance in Aircraft Structures* — Dirk Schürmann. Links nondestructive evaluation schedules with fracture mechanics predictions.
- *Practical Fracture Mechanics in Design* — Arun Kumar & Ashok Saxena. Provides design guidelines and monitoring strategies grounded in crack growth analysis.
