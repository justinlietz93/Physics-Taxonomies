# F1 Crack Growth Studies — Book Suggestions

Crack-growth teams rely on references that blend fracture mechanics with inspection tactics. These books keep analysts and inspectors synced on models, measurements, and reporting formats.

## Fracture Mechanics Foundations
- *Fracture Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications* — T. L. Anderson. Standard reference for stress intensity solutions, Paris-law parameters, and specimen compliance charts.
- *Elementary Engineering Fracture Mechanics* — David Broek. Clear derivations and worked examples for converting inspection data into life predictions.

## Monitoring and Inspection Manuals
- *Nondestructive Evaluation: Theory, Techniques, and Applications* — Tribikram Kundu. Links ultrasonic and eddy-current crack sizing procedures with fracture assessments.
- *Damage Tolerance of Metallic Structures* — Tomasz Kozlowski. Provides airline-style inspection intervals, allowable crack maps, and reporting templates.

## Data Analysis Playbooks
- *Metal Fatigue in Engineering* — Ralph I. Stephens et al. Covers load spectrum reconstruction, crack closure corrections, and uncertainty propagation for service histories.
- *Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics and Fatigue* — Tim Bedford & Roger Cooke. Introduces reliability methods for crack growth simulations feeding risk dashboards.
