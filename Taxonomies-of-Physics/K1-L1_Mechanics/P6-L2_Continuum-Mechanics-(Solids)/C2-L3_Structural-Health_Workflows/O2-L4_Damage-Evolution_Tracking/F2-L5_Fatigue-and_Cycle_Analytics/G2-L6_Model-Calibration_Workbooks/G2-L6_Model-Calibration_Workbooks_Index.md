# G2-L6_Model-Calibration_Workbooks — Genus Index
**Definition:** Updates simple digital models with measured strains so predictions stay trustworthy.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Workshop_Beam_FE_Update** — Refresh a beam finite-element model with strain data.
- **S2-L7_Plant_Frame_Digital_Twin_Tune** — Tune a plant frame digital twin using maintenance readings.
