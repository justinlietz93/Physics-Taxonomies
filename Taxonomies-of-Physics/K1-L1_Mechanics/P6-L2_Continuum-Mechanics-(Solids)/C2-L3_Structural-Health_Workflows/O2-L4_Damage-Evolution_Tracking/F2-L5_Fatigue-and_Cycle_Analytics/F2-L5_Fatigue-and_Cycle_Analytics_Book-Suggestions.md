# F2 Fatigue and Cycle Analytics — Book Suggestions

Cycle analytics references emphasize load spectrum processing, rainflow counting, and Miner’s rule applications. These texts support the data pipelines used in monitoring programs.

## Fatigue Data Processing
- *Fatigue Testing and Analysis* — Yung-Li Lee, Jwo Pan, Richard Hathaway & Mark Barkey. Covers rainflow counting, mean stress corrections, and damage accumulation workflows.
- *Metal Fatigue Analysis Handbook* — Yukitaka Murakami. Provides S–N data interpretation and cycle counting procedures for various metals.

## Structural Health Monitoring
- *Fatigue and Fracture Reliability Engineering* — Efstratios Nikolaidis et al. Links probabilistic damage metrics with monitoring data for aerospace and civil structures.
- *Structural Health Monitoring Technologies for the 21st Century* — D.A. Weichert & G. Maier (eds.). Discusses fatigue analytics within broader SHM systems.

## Software and Implementation Guides
- *Practical Guide to the Use of Miner’s Rule* — ASTM STP 462 Compilation. Presents industry case studies and validation techniques for damage summation.
- *Fatigue of Structures* — John W. Fisher et al. Details data acquisition, spectrum editing, and design implications for steel bridges and similar assets.
