# F2 Fatigue and Cycle Analytics — Book Suggestions

Turning load histories into fatigue outlooks needs resources spanning counting algorithms, material data, and reliability methods. These works equip analysts to defend maintenance intervals with clear evidence.

## Fatigue Fundamentals
- *Metal Fatigue Analysis Handbook* — Yung-Li Lee et al. Comprehensive coverage of S–N curves, mean-stress corrections, and Miner’s rule implementations.
- *Fatigue of Materials* — Suresh S. Suresh. Explains microstructural origins of fatigue parameters and provides charts for metallic and polymer systems.

## Cycle Counting and Signal Processing
- *Fatigue Testing and Analysis: Theory and Practice* — Yung-Li Lee et al. Walkthroughs of rainflow counting, load spectrum creation, and laboratory correlation.
- *Random Vibration: Mechanical, Structural, and Earthquake Engineering Applications* — Ahmed A. Shabana. Spectral techniques for estimating fatigue response from random loads.

## Reliability and Fleet Management
- *Practical Fracture Mechanics in Design* — Alexander Blake. Offers design allowables, inspection planning, and fatigue damage auditing templates.
- *Engineering Design Reliability Applications* — Efstratios Nikolaidis et al. Introduces probabilistic methods for translating fatigue damage metrics into risk-based maintenance decisions.
