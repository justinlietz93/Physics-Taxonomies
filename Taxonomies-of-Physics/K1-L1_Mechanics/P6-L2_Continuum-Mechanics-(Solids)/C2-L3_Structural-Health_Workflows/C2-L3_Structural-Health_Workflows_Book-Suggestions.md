# C2 Structural Health Workflows — Book Suggestions

Structural health monitoring tracks how stresses, cracks, and fatigue accumulate. These books blend sensing, modeling, and decision strategies for class-level workflows.

## Monitoring Frameworks
- *Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective* — Charles R. Farrar & Keith Worden. Introduces data-driven pipelines for anomaly detection and damage prognosis.
- *Structural Health Monitoring* — Daniel Balageas, Claus-Peter Fritzen & Alfredo Güemes. Combines sensing technologies with physics-based models for real-time assessment.

## Diagnostics & Prognostics
- *Damage Prognosis for Aerospace, Civil and Mechanical Systems* — Douglas W. Brownjohn et al.. Discusses fatigue tracking, probabilistic remaining-life models, and decision metrics.
- *Fatigue of Structures and Materials* — Jaap Schijve. Provides crack growth laws, S-N curves, and inspection intervals that feed monitoring workflows.

## Sensing Technologies
- *Guided Waves in Structures for SHM* — F. Mustapha et al.. Explores Lamb wave excitation, sensing, and signal interpretation.
- *Fiber Optic Sensors* — Eric Udd & William B. Spillman Jr.. Covers distributed strain sensing and interrogation methods for long-span structures.
