# F2 Digital Imaging Monitoring — Book Suggestions

Digital imaging monitoring builds on computer vision, structural diagnostics, and DIC-specific manuals. These titles help practitioners set up cameras, process images, and interpret field data.

## Digital Image Correlation Fundamentals
- *Digital Image Correlation: A Practical Guide* — Michael A. Sutton, Jean-José Orteu & Hubert W. Schreier. Provides step-by-step instructions for DIC setup, calibration, and data analysis.
- *Image Correlation for Shape, Motion and Deformation Measurements* — Michael A. Sutton et al. Covers theoretical foundations and practical considerations for displacement and strain extraction.

## Structural Monitoring Applications
- *Structural Health Monitoring Using Genetic Fuzzy Systems* — Branko Glisic & Daniele Inaudi. Includes chapters on camera-based monitoring integrated with other sensing modalities.
- *Structural Health Monitoring of Large Structures Using DIC* — Dimitrios G. Aggelis (ed.). Presents case studies of bridges, turbines, and composites monitored via imaging.

## Computer Vision and Measurement
- *Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications* — Richard Szeliski. Supplies background on feature tracking and camera models relevant to DIC post-processing.
- *Photomechanics* — Pramod Rastogi (ed.). Discusses optical measurement techniques, including interferometry and DIC, for deformation mapping.
