# F2 Digital Imaging Monitoring — Book Suggestions

Imaging-based strain mapping leans on optics, calibration, and data reduction references. These titles keep field teams fluent in the full workflow from speckle prep to actionable dashboards.

## Digital Image Correlation Primers
- *Digital Image Correlation: Fundamentals and Applications* — Michael A. Sutton et al. Definitive treatment of subset correlation, calibration, and error sources.
- *Introduction to Digital Image Correlation* — H. Schreier & J. Sutton. Pocket-sized walkthrough with practical setup checklists for lab-to-field translation.

## Optics and Calibration
- *Experimental Mechanics of Solids* — César Sciammarella et al. Covers camera calibration, lighting design, and multi-view reconstruction strategies for structural diagnostics.
- *Handbook of Photogrammetry* — Wilfried Linder. Procedures for lens distortion correction and scaling needed when cameras are redeployed outdoors.

## Data Processing and Case Studies
- *Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective* — Charles R. Farrar & Keith Worden. Provides algorithms for cleaning, fusing, and interpreting displacement fields.
- *Full-Field Measurements and Identification in Solid Mechanics* — François Hild & Stéphane Roux (eds.). Compiles industrial case studies blending DIC with finite-element validation.
