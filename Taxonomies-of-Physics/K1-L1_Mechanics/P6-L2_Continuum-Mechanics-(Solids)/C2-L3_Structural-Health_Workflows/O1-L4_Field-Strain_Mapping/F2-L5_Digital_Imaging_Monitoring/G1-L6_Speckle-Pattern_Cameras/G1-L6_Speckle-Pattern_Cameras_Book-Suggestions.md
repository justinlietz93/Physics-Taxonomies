# G1 Speckle Pattern Cameras — Book Suggestions

These references teach digital image correlation from setup through data reduction so students can trust camera-based strain maps.

## DIC Fundamentals
- *Digital Image Correlation and Tracking* — Michael Sutton, Jean-Jacques Orteu & Hubert Schreier. Comprehensive coverage of correlation algorithms, calibration, and error sources.
- *Photomechanics* — Pramod Rastogi (ed.). Includes chapters on subset selection, speckle preparation, and strain calculation for laboratory contexts.

## Applied Case Studies
- *Full-Field Measurements and Identification in Solid Mechanics* — Michel, Hild & Roux. Demonstrates DIC workflows for metals, composites, and biological tissues.
- *Optical Methods for Solid Mechanics* — Gary Cloud. Connects optical strain methods to structural health monitoring and provides experimental tips.
