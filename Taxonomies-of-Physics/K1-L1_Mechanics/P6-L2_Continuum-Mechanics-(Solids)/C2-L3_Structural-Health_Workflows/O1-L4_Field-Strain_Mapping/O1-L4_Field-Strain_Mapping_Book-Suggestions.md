# O1 Field Strain Mapping — Book Suggestions

Field strain mapping relies on advanced optics and data processing. These texts guide practitioners through theory, instrumentation, and analysis workflows.

## Digital Image Correlation and Optical Methods
- *Digital Image Correlation for Non-Contact Deformation Measurements* — Michael A. Sutton et al. Authoritative reference on DIC fundamentals, calibration, and uncertainty quantification.
- *Optical Methods for Solid Mechanics* — Pramod Rastogi & Erwin Hack. Surveys speckle, moiré, and interferometric techniques for full-field displacement and strain.

## Structural Health Monitoring Context
- *Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective* — Charles R. Farrar & Keith Worden. Connects measured strain fields to damage detection and decision making.
- *Practical Structural Health Monitoring with DIC* — Markus G. R. Sause. Demonstrates laboratory and field deployments of DIC for components ranging from composites to steel structures.

## Data Processing and Uncertainty
- *Image Registration for Remote Sensing* — Jacqueline Le Moigne et al. Offers advanced algorithms for pixel-level registration relevant to accurate displacement tracking.
- *Uncertainty Quantification in Experimental Mechanics* — Christophe Boller et al. Provides statistical tools for interpreting noisy strain maps and validating measurement confidence.
