# F1 Portable Gauge Routines — Book Suggestions

Portable strain surveys lean on instrumentation handbooks and field-testing guides. These texts emphasize gauge installation, bridge circuitry, and data validation.

## Strain Gauge Instrumentation
- *Measurements for Mechanical Engineers* — Patrick O'Kelly & John Dunn. Covers strain gauge selection, wiring, and calibration for field work.
- *The Strain Gage Primer* — Richard P. Brown. Provides practical advice on bonding techniques, temperature compensation, and troubleshooting portable setups.

## Field Testing and Monitoring
- *Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective* — Charles R. Farrar & Keith Worden. Introduces field deployment practices and data interpretation for strain-based monitoring.
- *Handbook of Structural Health Monitoring* — Wieslaw Staszewski, Tommaso B. Limongelli & Michele Ubertini (eds.). Includes chapters on strain gauge surveys and portable equipment.

## Data Reduction and Reporting
- *Experimental Stress Analysis* — James W. Dally & William F. Riley. Explains rosette transformations, uncertainty estimation, and report preparation for strain measurements.
- *Practical Stress Analysis with Finite Elements* — Bryan J. Mac Donald. Links measured strains to finite element validation and provides templates for documenting field findings.
