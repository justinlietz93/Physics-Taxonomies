# F1 Portable Gauge Routines — Book Suggestions

Strain-gauge walkdowns thrive on compact references that mix wiring discipline with interpretation cheatsheets. These picks help crews stay consistent when redeploying gauges across bridges, plants, and rotating equipment.

## Field Setup Guides
- *Strain Gauge Technology* — A. L. Window. Covers gauge selection, bonding procedures, and lead compensation essentials tailored to portable deployments.
- *Practical Stress Analysis with Finite Elements* — Bryan J. Mac Donald. Couples quick experimental strain checks with companion finite-element predictions to validate readings on-site.

## Instrumentation Handbooks
- *Experimental Stress Analysis* — James W. Dally & William F. Riley. Classic Wheatstone bridge circuits, balancing tricks, and calibration routines for technicians.
- *Data Acquisition Handbook* — Measurement Computing. Concise amplifier, filtering, and sampling recommendations sized for temporary gauge racks.

## Application Playbooks
- *Structural Health Monitoring of Aerospace Composites* — F.-K. Chang (ed.). Case studies on using rosettes and temperature correction protocols in field inspections.
- *Bridge Evaluation, Repair, and Rehabilitation* — Parsons Brinckerhoff. Walkthroughs of periodic strain surveys on civil structures, emphasizing documentation templates and acceptance criteria.
