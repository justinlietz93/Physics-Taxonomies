# P6 Continuum Mechanics (Solids) — Book Suggestions

These titles cover the kinematics, constitutive laws, and computational tools required to analyze solid continua within mechanics.

## Elasticity & Fundamentals
- *Continuum Mechanics* — Anthony Bedford & David Drumheller. Introduces kinematics, balance laws, and constitutive modeling with clear derivations.
- *Theory of Elasticity* — Timoshenko & Goodier. Classic reference for stress-strain relations and boundary-value problems in solids.

## Plasticity & Viscoelasticity
- *Introduction to Plasticity* — Girard & Caltagirone. Presents yield criteria, flow rules, and hardening models with worked examples.
- *Viscoelastic Solids* — Roderic Lakes. Connects microstructural intuition to constitutive equations for time-dependent deformation.

## Computational Approaches
- *The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis* — Thomas J.R. Hughes. Provides variational formulations and implementation guidance for continuum problems.
- *Nonlinear Finite Elements for Continua and Structures* — Ted Belytschko, Wing Kam Liu, & Brian Moran. Extends finite element ideas to large deformation, plasticity, and contact scenarios.
