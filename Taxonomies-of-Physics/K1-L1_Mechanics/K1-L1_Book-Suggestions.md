# K1 Mechanics — Book Suggestions

Mechanics sets the intuitive grammar for how forces reshape motion. These titles keep the focus broad so the later phyla can dive deeper without repeating foundations.

## Broad Primers
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. A modern bridge from Newtonian intuition to Lagrangian formalisms with abundant worked examples that preview each L2 strand.
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Emphasizes conservation laws, rigid-body motion, and oscillations in a way that links directly to particles, resonance, and rotational sub-kingdoms.

## Conceptual & Historical Perspectives
- *Six Easy Pieces* — Richard P. Feynman. Offers narrative explanations of forces, energy, and conservation that anchor the overarching lenses before math-heavy dives.
- *The Elements of Mechanics* — Louis Bloomfield. Everyday anchors for forces, stability, and momentum transfer that mirror the taxonomy’s intuition-first approach.

## Problem-Solving Companions
- *Schaum's Outline of Lagrangian Dynamics* — Dare A. Wells. Compact derivations and practice problems spanning energy landscapes, constraints, and continuum previews.
- *Classical Mechanics: A Computational Approach* — Shlomo Ta'asan. Introduces numerical explorations of orbits, rigid bodies, and chaos, preparing readers for the nonlinear and computational phyla.
