# G2 Glove and Catcher Mitts â€” Core Equations

Catcher mitts shape collision impulses to protect hands. These equations highlight how force profiles, contact time, and energy absorption depend on glove padding and technique.

## Average Catch Force from Impulse
**Relates momentum change to felt load.**

$$\bar{F} = \frac{J}{\Delta t} = \frac{m (v_i - v_f)}{\Delta t}$$

- Longer contact time $\Delta t$ from a soft mitt lowers the average force $\bar{F}$ even when the impulse $J$ (momentum change) is fixed.

## Energy Absorbed by Padding
**Estimates how much kinetic energy the glove dissipates.**

$$E_{\text{abs}} = \tfrac{1}{2} m (v_i^2 - v_f^2)$$

- Comparing incoming and outgoing speeds reveals the energy that must be absorbed by glove padding or arm motion to prevent rebound.

## Effective Spring Constant of the Mitt Pocket
**Models glove compliance for training.**

$$k_{\text{eff}} = \frac{F_{\text{peak}}}{x_{\text{max}}}$$

- Treating the mitt as a spring, the peak deformation $x_{\text{max}}$ under peak force $F_{\text{peak}}$ sets an effective stiffness that players can adjust with break-in routines.
