# F1 Bounce and Rebound Stories — Book Suggestions

These references help lab instructors tune rebound experiments, covering restitution theory, force-plate analysis, and sport-oriented bounce optimization.

## Impact Fundamentals
- *Impact Mechanics* — W. J. Stronge. Provides clear restitution models and worked examples for normal and oblique bounces, ideal for translating $v^{+} = -e v^{-}$ data into design checks.
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Offers concise chapters on impulse-momentum methods with practical collision case studies.

## Measurement and Instrumentation
- *Experimental Methods for Science and Engineering Students* — Les Kirkup. Details force-sensor calibration, timing resolution, and data smoothing strategies for short collision windows.
- *Dynamic Testing of Advanced Materials* — Vadim V. Silberschmidt. Highlights high-rate measurement techniques and instrumentation layouts that directly support bounce characterizations.

## Applied Sports and Engineering Perspectives
- *The Physics of Sports* — Angelo Armenti Jr. Connects impact equations to ball sports, comparing rebound efficiencies across equipment choices.
- *Materials in Sports Equipment* — Mike Jenkins (ed.). Reviews material selection and surface engineering that govern bounce height, energy loss, and durability in athletic contexts.
