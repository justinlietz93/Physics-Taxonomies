# G1-L6_Ball-Against-Wall-Cycles — Genus Index
**Definition:** Groups fast rebounds where balls smack rigid surfaces and leave with flipped momentum.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Rubber-Ball_Wall-Rebound** — Playground bounces that reverse direction crisply.
- **S2-L7_Ping-Pong_Paddle-Bounce** — Table tennis pops that flip momentum in a blink.
