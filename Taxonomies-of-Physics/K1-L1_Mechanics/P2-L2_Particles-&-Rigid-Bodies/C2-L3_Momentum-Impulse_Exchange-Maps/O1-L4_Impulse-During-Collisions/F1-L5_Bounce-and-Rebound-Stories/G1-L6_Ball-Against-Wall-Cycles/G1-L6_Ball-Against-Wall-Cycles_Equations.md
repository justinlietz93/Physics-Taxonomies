# G1 Ball Against Wall Cycles â€” Core Equations

Repeated ball rebounds turn impulse and restitution into predictable bounce heights. These equations let coaches and students quantify speed changes, contact impulses, and energy loss each cycle.

## Velocity After Rebound with Restitution
**Captures speed reversal at impact.**

$$v_{\text{after}} = -e\, v_{\text{before}}$$

- Coefficient of restitution $e$ multiplies the inbound speed to give the outbound velocity magnitude, with the minus sign signaling direction reversal off the wall.

## Impulse Delivered by the Wall
**Links momentum change to contact forces.**

$$J = m (v_{\text{after}} - v_{\text{before}}) = -m (1+e) v_{\text{before}}$$

- The impulse $J$ quantifies average force over contact time; larger $e$ means less momentum loss and softer landings.

## Peak Height After Bounce
**Translates rebound speed into trajectory height.**

$$h_{n+1} = \frac{v_{\text{after}}^2}{2g} = e^2 h_n$$

- Because rebound speed scales with $e$, successive peak heights follow a geometric sequence $h_{n+1} = e^2 h_n$, useful for planning drill spacing.
