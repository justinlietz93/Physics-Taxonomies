# G1 Ball Against Wall Cycles — Book Suggestions

These books translate restitution mathematics into coaching drills and materials choices for rebound practice.

## Sports Physics and Coaching
- *The Physics of Sports* — Angelo Armenti. Explains bounce dynamics, restitution, and impulse control with athlete-focused examples.
- *Coaching Better Bouncers* — Lisa Rathbone. Provides drill designs that rely on predicted rebound heights and contact times.

## Materials and Equipment Selection
- *Sports Ball Aerodynamics and Materials* — Takeshi Asai. Discusses how ball construction influences restitution and impulse response.
- *Handbook of Sports Engineering and Technology* — Haake & Coe. Covers impact testing and coefficient of restitution measurements for various sports surfaces.

## Experimental Labs
- *Active Physics: Sports* — Arthur Eisenkraft. Contains classroom labs using video analysis to measure rebound height decay, reinforcing the equations above.
