# O1-L4_Impulse-During-Collisions — Order Index
**Definition:** Studies short contact intervals where strong forces deliver impulses that change momentum.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Bounce-and-Rebound-Stories** — Elastic-style collisions that return speed with a flip.
- **F2-L5_Impulse-Sharing-Scenarios** — Cushioned contacts that stretch impulse over time.
