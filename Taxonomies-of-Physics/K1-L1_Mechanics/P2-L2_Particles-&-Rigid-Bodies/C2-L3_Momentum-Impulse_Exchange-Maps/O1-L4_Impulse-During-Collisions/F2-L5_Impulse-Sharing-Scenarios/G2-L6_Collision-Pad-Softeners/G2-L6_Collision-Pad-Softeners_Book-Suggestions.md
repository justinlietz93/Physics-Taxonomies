- *Crash Cushion Design Manual* — FHWA. Provides pad thickness charts and energy absorption requirements for roadside attenuators.

## Sports and Protective Gear Applications
- *Protective Equipment Engineering for Sports* — James A. Bateman. Links pad stiffness to deceleration targets in athletic collisions.
- *Sports Engineering and Technology* — Haake & Coe. Includes testing protocols for padding and impact attenuation systems.

## Testing and Certification
- *ASTM Impact Testing Standards Compendium* — ASTM International. Summarizes drop and pendulum tests used to certify foam pads and bumpers.
