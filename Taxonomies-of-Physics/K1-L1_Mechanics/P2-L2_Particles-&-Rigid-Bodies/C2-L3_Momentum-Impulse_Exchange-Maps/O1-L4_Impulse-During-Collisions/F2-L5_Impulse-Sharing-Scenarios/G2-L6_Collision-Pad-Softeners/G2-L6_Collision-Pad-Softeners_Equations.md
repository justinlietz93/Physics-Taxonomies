# G2 Collision Pad Softeners â€” Core Equations

Padding systems stretch collision time to lower forces. These equations evaluate how pad stiffness, thickness, and restitution affect rider comfort and structural loads.

## Deceleration with Energy-Absorbing Foam
**Models constant-force foam crush.**

$$a = \frac{F_{\text{foam}}}{m} = \frac{\sigma A}{m}$$

- If foam delivers an approximately constant stress $\sigma$ over contact area $A$, the resulting deceleration $a$ sets expected g-levels on riders.

## Required Pad Thickness for Stopping Distance
**Ensures the foam stroke absorbs impact speed.**

$$t_{\text{pad}} = \frac{v_i^2}{2 a}$$

- To bring an incoming cart of speed $v_i$ to rest under deceleration $a$, the pad thickness $t_{\text{pad}}$ must provide sufficient crush distance.

## Effective Coefficient of Restitution with Foam Cover
**Combines structural rebound with padding loss.**

$$e_{\text{eff}} = e_{\text{structure}} e_{\text{foam}}$$

- When foam covers a bumper, the overall restitution is the product of structural and foam coefficients, showing how softer pads reduce rebound speed.
