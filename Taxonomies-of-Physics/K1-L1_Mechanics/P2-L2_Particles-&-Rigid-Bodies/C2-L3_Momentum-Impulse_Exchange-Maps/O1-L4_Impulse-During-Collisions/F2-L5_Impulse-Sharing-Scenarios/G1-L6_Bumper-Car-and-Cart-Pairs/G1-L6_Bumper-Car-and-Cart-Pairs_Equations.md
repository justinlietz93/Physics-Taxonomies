# G1 Bumper Car and Cart Pairs â€” Core Equations

Bumper cars share impulse between riders through inelastic collisions. These equations model momentum transfer, shared velocity, and energy loss for ride planning.

## Conservation of Linear Momentum
**Determines shared velocity after impact.**

$$m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = (m_1 + m_2) v_f$$

- When carts stick together, the combined velocity $v_f$ comes from total initial momentum, shaping how hard the second rider feels the hit.

## Fraction of Kinetic Energy Lost
**Quantifies dissipation during inelastic impacts.**

$$\Delta E = \tfrac{1}{2} m_1 v_{1i}^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_2 v_{2i}^2 - \tfrac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2) v_f^2$$

- Comparing initial and final kinetic energies reveals how much energy the bumpers must absorb, guiding foam or hydraulic design.

## Average Impact Force Estimate
**Relates impulse to ride comfort.**

$$\bar{F} = \frac{(m_1 + m_2)(v_f - v_{1i})}{\Delta t}$$

- Estimating contact duration $\Delta t$ allows designers to check that average impact forces remain within safe limits for riders.
