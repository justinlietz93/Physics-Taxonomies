# F2 Impulse Sharing Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Use these sources to stage two-body collision labs and design safer protective systems by understanding how impulse divides between participants.

## Analytical Foundations
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Grant R. Fowles & George L. Cassiday. Covers impulse-momentum methods with thorough derivations for two-body impacts and constraint forces.
- *Intermediate Dynamics for Engineers* — Oliver M. O'Reilly. Provides step-by-step treatments of multi-body impacts, including restitution models and reduced-mass interpretations.

## Reconstruction and Safety Applications
- *Accident Reconstruction: Fundamentals and Applications* — Christopher D. Armstrong. Demonstrates momentum-sharing calculations for vehicle and pedestrian collisions with real data workflows.
- *Handbook of Human Vibration* — M. J. Griffin. Offers biomechanical response data that ties impulse limits to occupant protection and tool design.

## Experimental and Numerical Toolkits
- *Computational Dynamics* — Ahmed A. Shabana. Explains numerical integration and contact modeling used to verify impulse exchange in multibody simulations.
- *High-Speed Imaging for Motion Analysis* — Gerlind Plonka-Hoch & Karsten Rodenacker. Guides camera-based measurement setups that capture the velocity histories required for impulse partitioning.
