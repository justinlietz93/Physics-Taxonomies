# O1 Impulse During Collisions — Book Suggestions

Capturing short collision events requires impulse methods that integrate forces over impact windows; these books connect the time integral viewpoint with experimental restitution data.

## Collision Fundamentals
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Derives impulse-momentum relations and coefficient of restitution for central impacts.
- *Mechanics* — L. D. Landau & E. M. Lifshitz. Frames impulsive forces as momentum discontinuities and links them to conservation laws.

## Applied Impact Analysis
- *Impact Dynamics* — Jerry Ginsberg. Explores rigid-body and deformable-contact impulse models, including oblique and eccentric hits.
- *Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics* — R. C. Hibbeler. Provides design-oriented treatments of impact problems with clear free-body diagrams.

## Experimental & Measurement Guides
- *Experimental Methods for Engineers* — J. P. Holman. Details instrumentation for capturing short-duration forces to verify impulse predictions.
- *Vehicle Crash Mechanics* — Matthew Huang. Illustrates how crash tests convert measured force-time histories into impulse and post-impact velocity estimates.
