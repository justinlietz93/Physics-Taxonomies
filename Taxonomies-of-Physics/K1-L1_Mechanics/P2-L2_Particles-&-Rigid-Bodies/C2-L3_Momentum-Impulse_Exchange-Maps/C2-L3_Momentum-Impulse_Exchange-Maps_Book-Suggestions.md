# C2 Momentum, Impulse & Exchange Maps — Book Suggestions

Momentum diagrams track how impacts, jets, and multi-body interactions redistribute motion. These references emphasize impulse bookkeeping and conservation arguments across collisions and rockets.

## Impulse Concepts
- *An Introduction to Mechanics* — Daniel Kleppner & Robert Kolenkow. Derives momentum conservation from Newton's laws and applies it to elastic, inelastic, and variable-mass systems.
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Jerry B. Marion & Stephen T. Thornton. Highlights center-of-mass frames, impulse response, and scattering angles that make exchange diagrams intuitive.

## Collision Case Studies
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Grant R. Fowles & George L. Cassiday. Pairs collision typologies with worked impulse-momentum solutions across translational and rotational degrees of freedom.
- *Mechanics of Materials* — Gere & Goodno. Uses impact loading of beams and columns to show how momentum jumps translate into stress waves and design checks.

## Variable-Mass & Jet Applications
- *Classical Mechanics: A Modern Perspective* — Vernon Barger & Martin Olsson. Treats rockets and multi-stage propulsion with momentum control surfaces that echo exchange maps.
- *Rocket Propulsion Elements* — George P. Sutton & Oscar Biblarz. Connects control-volume impulse balances to thrust curves, nozzle design, and staging strategies.
