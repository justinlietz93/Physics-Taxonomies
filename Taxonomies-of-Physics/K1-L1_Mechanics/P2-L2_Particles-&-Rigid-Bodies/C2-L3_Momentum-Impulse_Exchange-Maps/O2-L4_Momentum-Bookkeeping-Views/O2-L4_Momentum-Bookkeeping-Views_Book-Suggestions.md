# O2 Momentum Bookkeeping Views — Book Suggestions

Tracking momentum across interacting subsystems calls for clear bookkeeping of internal versus external forces; these texts highlight systematic control-volume and center-of-mass approaches.

## Conservation Frameworks
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein, Charles Poole, & John Safko. Frames momentum conservation via symmetries and demonstrates how generalized momenta track through constraints.
- *Introduction to Classical Mechanics* — David Morin. Offers intuitive momentum-accounting examples involving rockets, variable-mass systems, and multi-particle interactions.

## System & Control-Volume Methods
- *Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics* — Anthony M. Bedford & Wallace L. Fowler. Provides control-volume formulations for particles and rigid bodies with careful external force identification.
- *Mechanics of Fluids* — B. S. Massey & John Ward-Smith. Includes momentum-control-volume examples (jets, nozzles) that sharpen bookkeeping of surface forces versus momentum flux.

## Computational & Data Perspectives
- *Computational Mechanics of Probabilistic and Stochastic Systems* — Paolo L. P. Maffettone & others. Discusses numerical momentum tracking when forces are uncertain or data-driven.
- *Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Philip R. Bevington & D. Keith Robinson. Shows how to propagate measurement error when summing momenta from multi-sensor experiments.
