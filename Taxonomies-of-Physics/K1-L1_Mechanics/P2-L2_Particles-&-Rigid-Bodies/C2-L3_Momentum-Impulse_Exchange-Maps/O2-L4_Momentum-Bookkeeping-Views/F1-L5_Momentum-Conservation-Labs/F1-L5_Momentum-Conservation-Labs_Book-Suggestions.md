# F1 Momentum Conservation Labs — Book Suggestions

These resources support instructors running conservation-of-momentum experiments by combining conceptual clarity with measurement guidance.

## Conceptual Overviews
- *University Physics with Modern Physics* — Young & Freedman. Presents momentum conservation with extensive worked examples and lab-ready exercises.
- *Classical Mechanics: A Modern Perspective* — Vernon Barger & Martin Olsson. Emphasizes system momentum and center-of-mass reasoning useful for planning lab narratives.

## Laboratory Design and Data Handling
- *RealTime Physics: Active Learning Laboratories Module 1* — Sokoloff, Laws & Thornton. Supplies air-track and cart labs with data templates that stress momentum bookkeeping.
- *Experimental Physics: Principles and Practice for the Laboratory* — Walter F. Smith. Covers motion sensing, uncertainty analysis, and experimental design specific to conservation tests.

## Advanced Extensions
- *An Introduction to Error Analysis* — John R. Taylor. Guides statistical treatment of before/after momentum comparisons and impulse estimates.
- *Hands-On Physics Activities with Real-Life Applications* — James Cunningham & Norman Herr. Offers classroom-tested activities and extensions for multi-dimensional momentum tracking.
