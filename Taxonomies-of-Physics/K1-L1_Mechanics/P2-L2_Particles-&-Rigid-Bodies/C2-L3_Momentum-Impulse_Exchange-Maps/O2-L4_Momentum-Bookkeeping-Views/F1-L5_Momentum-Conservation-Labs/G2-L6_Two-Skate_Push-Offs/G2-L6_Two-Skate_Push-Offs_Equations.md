# G2 Two Skate Push-Offs â€” Core Equations

Students on low-friction carts can push apart to reveal internal forces conserving momentum. These equations quantify recoil speeds, relative motion, and kinetic energy sharing.

## Equal and Opposite Momentum
**Ensures system momentum remains zero.**

$$m_A v_A + m_B v_B = 0$$

- When skaters start from rest and push off, their momenta cancel; measuring one velocity immediately sets the other through $v_B = -\frac{m_A}{m_B} v_A$.

## Relative Separation Speed
**Predicts how quickly the carts move apart.**

$$v_{\text{rel}} = |v_A - v_B| = v_A \left(1 + \frac{m_A}{m_B}\right)$$

- Knowing masses and one velocity gives the rate at which carts separate, useful for timing photogate spacing.

## Kinetic Energy Partition
**Shows how energy divides between skaters.**

$$K_A = \tfrac{1}{2} m_A v_A^2, \qquad K_B = \tfrac{1}{2} m_B v_B^2$$

- Even though total momentum is zero, total kinetic energy becomes $\tfrac{1}{2} m_A v_A^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_B v_B^2$, highlighting that lighter skaters gain more speed.
