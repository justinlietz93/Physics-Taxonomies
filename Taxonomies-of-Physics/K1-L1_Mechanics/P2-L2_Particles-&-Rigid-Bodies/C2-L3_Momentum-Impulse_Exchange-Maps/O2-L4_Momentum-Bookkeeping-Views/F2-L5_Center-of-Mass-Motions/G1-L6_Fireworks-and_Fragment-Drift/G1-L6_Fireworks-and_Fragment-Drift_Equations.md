# G1 Fireworks and Fragment Drift â€” Core Equations

Exploding shells scatter fragments while conserving momentum. These equations track center-of-mass motion, recoil velocities, and spread patterns after bursts.

## Center of Mass Continues on Pre-Burst Path
**Shows external forces dominate overall motion.**

$$\vec{R}_{\text{CM}}(t) = \vec{R}_{\text{CM}}(0) + \vec{V}_{\text{CM}} t$$

- In absence of external forces, the center of mass travels uniformly; fireworks fragments follow this reference trajectory even while they disperse.

## Fragment Recoil Velocities
**Use momentum balance to determine spreads.**

$$m_1 \vec{v}_1 + m_2 \vec{v}_2 + \cdots = M \vec{V}_{\text{CM}}$$

- Knowing the center-of-mass velocity $\vec{V}_{\text{CM}}$ and masses $m_i$ lets technicians allocate fragment velocities that still satisfy total momentum conservation.

## Radial Spread Estimate
**Relates fragment speed to drift distance.**

$$r(t) \approx v_{\text{rel}} t$$

- The relative speed $v_{\text{rel}}$ of fragments away from the center sets the visible shell radius after time $t$, supporting choreography of aerial displays.
