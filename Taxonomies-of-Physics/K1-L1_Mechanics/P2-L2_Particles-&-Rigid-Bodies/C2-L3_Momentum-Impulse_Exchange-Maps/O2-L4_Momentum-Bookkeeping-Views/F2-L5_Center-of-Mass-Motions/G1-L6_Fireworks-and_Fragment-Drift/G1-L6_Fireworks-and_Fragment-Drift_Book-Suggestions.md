# G1 Fireworks and Fragment Drift — Book Suggestions

These books connect center-of-mass motion and fragment spreads to fireworks choreography and forensic analysis.

## Pyrotechnic Design
- *Fireworks: Principles and Practice* — Ronald Lancaster. Covers shell break timing, fragment distribution, and center-of-mass tracking for aerial displays.
- *The Chemistry of Fireworks* — Michael S. Russell. Includes calculations on fragment velocities and spread patterns for show planning.

## Explosion Dynamics and Forensics
- *Explosions in Air* — W.E. Baker. Provides momentum conservation treatments and fragment dispersion models applicable to fireworks safety.
- *Forensic Engineering of Advanced Materials* — Peter Rhys Lewis. Discusses reconstruction of fragmentation events using center-of-mass arguments.

## Visualization and Simulation
- *Computer Simulation of Liquids and Particles* — Allen & Tildesley. Offers techniques to simulate fragment drift and compare with measured shell patterns.
