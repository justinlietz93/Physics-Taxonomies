# F2 Center of Mass Motions — Book Suggestions

These references support projects that monitor system-wide motion, from athlete tracking to coordinated robot maneuvers.

## Theory and Intuition
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Gives clear derivations of center-of-mass motion, kinetic energy partitioning, and decoupling of translation from internal motion.
- *Mechanics* — L. D. Landau & E. M. Lifshitz. Presents elegant CM treatments and integral forms suited for complex mass distributions.

## Biomechanics and Robotics Applications
- *Dynamics of Multibody Systems* — Jens Wittenburg. Explains coordinate choices and CM calculations essential for robot gait planning and manipulation tasks.
- *Biomechanics of Sport and Exercise* — Peter McGinnis. Demonstrates CM tracking in athletics with motion-capture examples and measurement strategies.

## Measurement and Data Analysis
- *Introduction to Human Factors and Ergonomics* — Robert Bridger. Connects CM assessments to balance, stability, and workplace design studies.
- *Practical Motion Capture in Physics and Biomechanics* — Malcolm Danielson. Provides workflows for extracting CM trajectories from sensor suites and marker-based systems.
