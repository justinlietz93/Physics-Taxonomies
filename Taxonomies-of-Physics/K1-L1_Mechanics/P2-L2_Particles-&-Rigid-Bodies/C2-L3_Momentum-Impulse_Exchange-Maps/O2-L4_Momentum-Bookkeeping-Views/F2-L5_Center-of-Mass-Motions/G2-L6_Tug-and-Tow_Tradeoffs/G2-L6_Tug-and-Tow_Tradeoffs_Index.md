# G2-L6_Tug-and-Tow_Tradeoffs — Genus Index
**Definition:** Collects tugging and towing teams that keep their shared center-of-mass path predictable.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Canoe_Paddle-Partnership** — Paddling partners aligning strokes to guide the shared center.
- **S2-L7_Two-Kids_Rope-Tug** — Playground rope pulls that reveal the combined mass midpoint motion.
