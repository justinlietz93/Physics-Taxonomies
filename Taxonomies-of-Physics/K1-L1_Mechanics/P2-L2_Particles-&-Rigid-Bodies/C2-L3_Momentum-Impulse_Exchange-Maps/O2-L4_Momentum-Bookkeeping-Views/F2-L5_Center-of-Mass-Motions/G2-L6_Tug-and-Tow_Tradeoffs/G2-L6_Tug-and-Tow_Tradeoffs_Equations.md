# G2 Tug and Tow Tradeoffs â€” Core Equations

Towing scenarios treat multi-body systems as linked masses exchanging momentum. These equations evaluate tension, acceleration, and energy distribution when tugboats or tow trucks share loads.

## System Acceleration Under Shared Thrust
**Balances total pull against combined mass.**

$$a = \frac{F_{\text{tug}} - F_{\text{drag}}}{m_{\text{tug}} + m_{\text{tow}}}$$

- Net acceleration depends on tug thrust and aggregate mass, highlighting the tradeoff between pulling harder and towing heavier loads.

## Towline Tension During Acceleration
**Allocates force between tug and tow.**

$$T = m_{\text{tow}} a + F_{\text{drag,tow}}$$

- The towline must supply acceleration for the towed mass plus resist drag; this equation keeps line ratings within safe limits.

## Power Requirement for Steady Towing
**Links speed, drag, and delivered power.**

$$P = F_{\text{drag,total}} v$$

- Once at steady speed $v$, total drag sets the power the tug must deliver, letting operators gauge fuel needs and choose tow speeds.
