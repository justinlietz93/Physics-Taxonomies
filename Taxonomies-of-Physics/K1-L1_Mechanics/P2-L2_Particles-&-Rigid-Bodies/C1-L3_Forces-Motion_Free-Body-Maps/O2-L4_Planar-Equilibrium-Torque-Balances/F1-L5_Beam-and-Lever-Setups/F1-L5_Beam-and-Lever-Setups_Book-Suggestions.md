# F1 Beam and Lever Setups — Book Suggestions

These books help makers and lab techs plan lever arms, shelving, and jack systems that rely on tidy torque balances.

## Lever Mechanics Foundations
- *Vector Mechanics for Engineers: Statics* — Ferdinand P. Beer & E. Russell Johnston Jr. Establishes free-body diagrams and torque balance methods for simple levers and beams.
- *Engineering Mechanics: Statics* — J. L. Meriam & L. G. Kraige. Provides detailed examples of two-support reaction calculations and design of everyday lever devices.

## Structural Design References
- *Structural Analysis* — R. C. Hibbeler. Covers distributed loads, shear-moment diagrams, and safety factors for beams supporting household or lab fixtures.
- *Simplified Engineering for Architects and Builders* — James Ambrose & Patrick Tripeny. Translates statics into practical design rules for shelves, joists, and cantilevered supports.

## Hands-On Guides
- *The Art of Rigging* — George Dawson. Shares practical lever and block arrangements for lifting and staging tasks, with emphasis on reaction estimation.
- *Mechanical Advantage Projects* — Richard S. Evans. Offers workshop activities exploring fulcrum placement, handle extensions, and load sharing.
