# G1 Seesaw and Shelf Examples â€” Core Equations

Static torque balances let designers position people or loads on planks without tipping. These equations translate lever arms and support forces into everyday balancing rules for seesaws and wall shelves.

## Torque Balance About the Pivot
**Guarantees rotational equilibrium.**

$$\sum \tau = F_1 d_1 - F_2 d_2 = 0$$

- For two loads $F_1$ and $F_2$ located at distances $d_1$ and $d_2$ from the pivot, equilibrium requires equal and opposite torques, guiding where riders or boxes should sit.

## Reaction Forces at Supports
**Distributes weight between left and right brackets.**

$$R_L + R_R = W, \qquad R_L = \frac{W d_R}{d_L + d_R}$$

- For a shelf supported at two brackets separated by $d_L + d_R$, the reactions share the total weight $W$ in proportion to distances, preventing overload of a single bracket.

## Maximum Allowable Load Before Slip
**Checks friction limits at the pivot or support pads.**

$$F_{\text{max}} = \mu_s N$$

- The frictional holding force $F_{\text{max}}$ equals the static coefficient $\mu_s$ times normal load $N$; exceeding this threshold lets a shelf slide or a seesaw pivot slip.
