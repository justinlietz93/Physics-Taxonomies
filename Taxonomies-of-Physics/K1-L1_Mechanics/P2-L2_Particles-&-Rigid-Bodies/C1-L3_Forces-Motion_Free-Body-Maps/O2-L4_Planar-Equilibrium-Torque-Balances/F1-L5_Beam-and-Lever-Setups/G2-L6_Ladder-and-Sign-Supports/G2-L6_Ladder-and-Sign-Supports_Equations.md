# G2 Ladder and Sign Supports — Core Equations

Leaning ladders and cantilevered signs rely on planar equilibrium to stay upright. These equations link support reactions, friction limits, and allowable loads for field inspections.

## Reaction Components at the Base
**Resolves wall and ground forces.**

$$\sum F_x: R_W = R_G \tan\theta, \qquad \sum F_y: R_G = W$$

- With ladder angle $\theta$ and total weight $W$, the ground reaction $R_G$ balances vertical load while the wall reaction $R_W$ supplies horizontal balance; their relation follows from zero net moment about the ladder’s center.

## No-Slip Condition at the Ground Foot
**Ensures friction can supply the required horizontal force.**

$$R_W \leq \mu_s R_G$$

- Static friction coefficient $\mu_s$ must exceed the ratio $R_W/R_G$; inspectors use this inequality to judge whether a ladder or sign base will slip on the surface.

## Maximum Uniform Sign Load
**Limits weight that a cantilever bracket may carry.**

$$w_{\text{max}} = \frac{2 M_{\text{allow}}}{L^2}$$

- For bracket length $L$ and allowable moment $M_{\text{allow}}$ at the wall fasteners, the equivalent uniform load $w_{\text{max}}$ keeps bending stresses within limits.
