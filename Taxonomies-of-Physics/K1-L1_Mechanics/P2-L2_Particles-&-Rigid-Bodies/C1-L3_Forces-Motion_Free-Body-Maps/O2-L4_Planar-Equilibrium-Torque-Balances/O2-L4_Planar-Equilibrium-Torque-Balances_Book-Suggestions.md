# O2 Planar Equilibrium Torque Balances — Book Suggestions

Statics problems hinge on pairing force balance with torque balance, so these references train readers to frame 2D free-body diagrams and solve simultaneous equilibrium equations.

## Statics Foundations
- *Engineering Mechanics: Statics* — J. L. Meriam & L. G. Kraige. Provides systematic procedures for resolving planar forces and moments with plentiful diagrams.
- *Vector Mechanics for Engineers: Statics* — Beer, Johnston, & Mazurek. Emphasizes torque sign conventions and support reactions for beams, frames, and machines.

## Worked Examples & Practice
- *Schaum's Outline of Engineering Mechanics: Statics* — E. W. Nelson & C. L. Best. Offers step-by-step sample problems that reinforce \(\sum F = 0\) and \(\sum \tau = 0\) workflows.
- *1000 Solved Problems in Engineering Mechanics* — Joseph F. Shelly. Supplies varied planar equilibrium scenarios, from ladders to trusses, to refine equation setup speed.

## Applications & Design Guides
- *Mechanics of Materials* — Ferdinand P. Beer et al. Links torque balance to internal shear and bending demands in structural members.
- *Statics and Strength of Materials for Architecture and Building Construction* — Onouye & Kane. Connects equilibrium analysis to real building components and load paths.
