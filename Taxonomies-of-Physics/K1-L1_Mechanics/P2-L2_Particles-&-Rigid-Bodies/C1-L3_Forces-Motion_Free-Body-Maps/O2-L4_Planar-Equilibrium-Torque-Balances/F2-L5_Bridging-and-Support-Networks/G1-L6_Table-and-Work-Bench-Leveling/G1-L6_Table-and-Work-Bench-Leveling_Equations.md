# G1 Table and Work Bench Leveling â€” Core Equations

Leveling networks rely on distributing loads and adjusting leg heights. These equations help technicians quantify shim heights, reaction forces, and allowable deflection for sturdy work surfaces.

## Reaction Force Distribution for Uneven Legs
**Predicts how weight shifts among adjustable feet.**

$$R_i = W \frac{d_i}{\sum d_i}$$

- Approximating a rigid tabletop with three-point support, each reaction $R_i$ shares total weight $W$ in proportion to lever-arm distances $d_i$ from the centroid, guiding shim adjustments.

## Shim Height Needed to Correct Tilt
**Relates tilt angle to leg extension.**

$$\Delta h = L \tan\alpha$$

- If the bench tilts by angle $\alpha$ over leg spacing $L$, raising the low leg by $\Delta h$ restores a level surface, linking bubble-level readings to physical adjustments.

## Allowable Deflection Under Uniform Load
**Keeps surfaces stiff enough for precision tasks.**

$$\delta_{\text{max}} = \frac{5 w L^4}{384 E I}$$

- Modeling the benchtop as a simply supported beam of span $L$, modulus $E$, and moment of inertia $I$, the deflection limit $\delta_{\text{max}}$ ensures tools remain aligned during use.
