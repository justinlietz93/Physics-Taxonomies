# F2 Bridging and Support Networks — Book Suggestions

These references cover the statics, materials, and field practices needed to design multi-leg supports, suspension points, and cable networks.

## Structural Network Analysis
- *Matrix Analysis of Structures* — Aslam Kassimali. Provides systematic joint-equilibrium formulations suited to solving multi-support tension systems.
- *Form and Forces: Designing Efficient, Expressive Structures* — Edward Allen & Wacław Zalewski. Illustrates graphical statics and cable-net intuition for architectural supports.

## Cable and Tension System Design
- *Cable Structures* — David P. Billington. Surveys suspended roofs, bridges, and guyed towers with emphasis on tension distribution and safety margins.
- *Stay Cable Bridge Engineering* — Khaled Mahmoud. Details load balancing, anchor design, and monitoring strategies for cable-supported spans.

## Practical Rigging and Field Guides
- *Rigging Engineering Basics* — Jerry Klinke. Translates equilibrium math into rigging plans, sling selection, and inspection routines for temporary supports.
- *Entertainment Rigging for the 21st Century* — Bill Sapsis. Focuses on multi-point hangs, truss grids, and redundancy planning in event installations.
