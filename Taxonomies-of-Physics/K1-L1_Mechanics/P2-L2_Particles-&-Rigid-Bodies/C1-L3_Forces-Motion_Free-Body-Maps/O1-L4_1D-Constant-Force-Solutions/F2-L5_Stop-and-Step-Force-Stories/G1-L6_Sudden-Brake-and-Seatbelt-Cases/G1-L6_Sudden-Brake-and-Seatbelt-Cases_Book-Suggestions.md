# G1 Sudden Brake and Seatbelt Cases — Book Suggestions

These books connect constant-force stop calculations with crash sled testing and occupant protection strategies.

## Vehicle Dynamics and Braking Fundamentals
- *Fundamentals of Vehicle Dynamics* — Thomas D. Gillespie. Breaks down brake force generation, deceleration envelopes, and stopping distance predictions for road and rail vehicles.
- *Vehicle Braking and Traction* — Andrew Day. Focuses on constant-deceleration tests and tire-road force limits that frame seatbelt loading analyses.

## Occupant Protection and Restraint Design
- *Automotive Seatbelts and Airbags* — Richard Kent. Details belt geometry, load limiters, and test protocols that rely on uniform deceleration models.
- *Crash Safety Engineering* — Donald E. Huelke. Shows how crash sled experiments translate measured decelerations into restraint design choices.

## Testing and Standards
- *Motor Vehicle Crash Testing and Analysis* — Donald Friedman. Provides instrumentation practices and regulatory stop-distance criteria that map directly to the equations above.
