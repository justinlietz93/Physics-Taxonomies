# G1 Sudden Brake and Seatbelt Cases â€” Core Equations

Emergency stops translate constant braking forces into decelerations riders feel in their belts. These relations track how braking torque converts to stopping distance and restraint loading.

## Constant Deceleration from Brake Force
**Connects brake pads or tires to cabin slowdowns.**

$$a = -\frac{F_{\text{brake}}}{m}$$

- A nearly constant braking force $F_{\text{brake}}$ on mass $m$ produces a uniform deceleration $a$, establishing the base parameter for stop-time calculations.

## Stopping Distance Under Uniform Deceleration
**Predicts how much track is needed to come to rest.**

$$d = \frac{v_0^2}{2|a|}$$

- With initial speed $v_0$, the vehicle needs distance $d$ to halt; this equation drives safe buffer design for rail systems and test sleds.

## Seatbelt Tension Estimate
**Converts deceleration into harness loads.**

$$T \approx m_{\text{occupant}}(|a| + g \sin\theta)$$

- For an occupant of mass $m_{\text{occupant}}$ at seatback angle $\theta$, belt tension $T$ sums inertial deceleration and any gravity component, guiding restraint strength specifications.
