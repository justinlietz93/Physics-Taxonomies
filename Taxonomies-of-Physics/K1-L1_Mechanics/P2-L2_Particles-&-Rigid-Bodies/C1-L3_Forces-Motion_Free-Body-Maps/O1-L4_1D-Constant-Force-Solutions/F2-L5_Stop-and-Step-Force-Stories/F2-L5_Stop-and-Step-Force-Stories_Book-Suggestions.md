# F2 Stop and Step Force Stories — Book Suggestions

These references emphasize how to plan, measure, and control segmented force applications such as conveyor launches, push-starts, and braking drills.

## System Dynamics Foundations
- *Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics* — J. L. Meriam & L. G. Kraige. Breaks motion into time windows with constant forces and highlights impulse matching between segments.
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Develops momentum and energy methods that simplify stepwise forcing scenarios.

## Control and Actuation Guides
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene F. Franklin, J. David Powell & Abbas Emami-Naeini. Discusses duty cycles, actuator saturation, and command shaping for on/off force control.
- *Modern Control Engineering* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Provides discrete-time modeling techniques for systems that alternate between driven and coasting phases.

## Experimental and Measurement Resources
- *Measurement and Instrumentation: Theory and Application* — Alan S. Morris & Reza Langari. Covers force transducers, timing sensors, and data acquisition strategies for short pulses.
- *Vehicle Braking and Chassis Control* — Max S. Fuchs. Offers case studies on staged braking forces, impulse management, and verification of stop-distance regulations.
