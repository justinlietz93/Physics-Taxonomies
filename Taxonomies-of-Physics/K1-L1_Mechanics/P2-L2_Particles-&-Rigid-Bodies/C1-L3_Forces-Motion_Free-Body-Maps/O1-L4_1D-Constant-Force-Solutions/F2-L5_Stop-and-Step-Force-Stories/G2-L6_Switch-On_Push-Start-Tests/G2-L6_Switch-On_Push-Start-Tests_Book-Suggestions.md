# G2 Switch-On Push Start Tests — Book Suggestions

These books help teams design and validate constant-force push starts for conveyors, launch carts, and lab rigs.

## Actuator and Drive Selection
- *Industrial Motion Control* — H. Scott Fogler. Explains sizing of linear actuators and constant-force drives for push-start segments.
- *Electric Motor Drive Installation and Troubleshooting* — Glen A. Mazur. Covers start-up torque management and acceleration testing for production machinery.

## Commissioning and Test Methods
- *Practical Machinery Launch and Commissioning* — Mike Sondalini. Provides ramp-up timing templates, push-distance calculations, and acceptance checklists.
- *Testing and Balancing HVAC & Process Fans* — Matthew S. Meckler. Though fan-focused, it details constant-acceleration start tests and data capture routines transferable to push-start rigs.

## Safety and Ergonomics
- *Human Factors in Equipment Design* — Woodson & Tillman. Outlines safe acceleration envelopes and reach distances that ensure push-start sequences stay within ergonomic limits.
