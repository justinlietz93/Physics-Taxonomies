# G1 Ramp and Launch Cases â€” Core Equations

Ramps translate constant thrust or gravity components into smooth takeoffs. These relations connect slope geometry, acceleration, and liftoff speed so instructors can map textbook kinematics onto skateboard runs or roller-coaster drops.

## Component of Weight Along a Ramp
**Sets the effective acceleration down the incline.**

$$a_{\parallel} = g \sin\theta$$

- With $\theta$ as the ramp angle from horizontal, the downhill acceleration equals the gravitational component along the ramp when friction is negligible, anchoring time-to-launch estimates.

## Travel Time Along the Ramp
**Links ramp length to launch timing.**

$$t = \sqrt{\frac{2L}{a_{\parallel}}}$$

- For an initial rest start, the time to cover ramp length $L$ under constant acceleration $a_{\parallel}$ follows the constant-acceleration relation $L=\tfrac{1}{2}a_{\parallel} t^2$, guiding synchronized push-offs.

## Exit Speed at the Lip
**Determines launch velocity for projectile planning.**

$$v_{\text{exit}} = \sqrt{2 a_{\parallel} L}$$

- The final speed gained along the ramp sets the initial velocity magnitude for airborne motion, critical for ensuring the launch clears desired gaps or rails.

## Horizontal Launch Range from Ramp Lip
**Predicts landing distance for small launch angles.**

$$R \approx \frac{v_{\text{exit}}^2}{g}\sin(2\phi)$$

- If the ramp redirects riders by an angle $\phi$ above horizontal, the standard projectile range formula estimates where they will touch down, allowing safe placement of landing zones.
