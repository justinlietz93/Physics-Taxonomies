# G1 Ramp and Launch Cases — Book Suggestions

These titles show how to turn constant-acceleration algebra into real ramp takeoffs, blending skate-park intuition with engineering design practices.

## Kinematics Refreshers with Ramp Examples
- *Classical Mechanics: An Intuitive Approach* — Daniel Kleppner. Uses incline problems and launch transitions to reinforce constant-force motion for introductory audiences.
- *Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics* — Hibbeler. Provides worked ramp and roller-coaster examples that highlight normal-force resolution and launch speed control.

## Action-Sport and Amusement Engineering
- *Skatepark Physics* — Tony Cervone. Focuses on ramp shapes, approach speeds, and landing envelopes, great for students translating equations to board sports.
- *Theme Park Design & Engineering* — Steve Alcorn. Discusses coaster drops, launch synchronisation, and safety margins that map directly onto ramp analytics.

## Experimentation and Data Tracking
- *Practical Kinematics Labs* — Karen Cummings. Offers motion-tracker experiments on inclines and launches to validate the timing and velocity predictions in class.
