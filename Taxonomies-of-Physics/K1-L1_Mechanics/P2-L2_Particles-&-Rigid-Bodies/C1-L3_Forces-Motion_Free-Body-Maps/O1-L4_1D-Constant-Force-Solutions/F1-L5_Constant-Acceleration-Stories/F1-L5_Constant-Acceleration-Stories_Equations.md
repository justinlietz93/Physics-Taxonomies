# F1 Constant Acceleration Stories — Core Equations

Everyday ramp launches and elevator rides are governed by a handful of constant-acceleration relations. These expressions let technicians cross-check timing gates, motion sensors, and energy readouts for 1D force plateaus.

## Kinematic Updates
**Velocity under steady acceleration:**

$$v(t) = v_0 + a t$$

- Links instantaneous velocity $v$ to initial velocity $v_0$ and constant acceleration $a$ over elapsed time $t$.

**Displacement tracking:**

$$x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \tfrac{1}{2} a t^{2}$$

- Predicts position $x$ relative to start $x_0$, useful for programming motion controllers or checking video-tracked runs.

## Range and Timing Targets
**Solve for travel time given a displacement:**

$$t = \frac{-v_0 + \sqrt{v_0^{2} + 2 a \Delta x}}{a}$$

- Chooses the positive root to estimate how long a constant push needs to cover distance $\Delta x$ when $a \neq 0$.

**Average velocity over a constant-acceleration leg:**

$$\bar{v} = \frac{v_0 + v}{2}$$

- Simplifies photogate spacing or sensor sampling plans by averaging launch and final speeds.

## Energy and Force Cross-Checks
**Work–energy relation for constant $a$:**

$$v^{2} = v_0^{2} + 2 a \Delta x$$

- Quickly verifies accelerometer data by comparing speed changes to displacement under a constant net force.

**Force from acceleration measurements:**

$$F = m a$$

- Connects measured acceleration to applied net force for calibration carts or elevator load tests.

## Sensor-Derived Acceleration
**Finite-difference estimate:**

$$a_{\text{avg}} = \frac{v(t + \Delta t) - v(t)}{\Delta t}$$

- Extracts acceleration from sequential velocity readings, allowing noise filtering or diagnostic plots.
