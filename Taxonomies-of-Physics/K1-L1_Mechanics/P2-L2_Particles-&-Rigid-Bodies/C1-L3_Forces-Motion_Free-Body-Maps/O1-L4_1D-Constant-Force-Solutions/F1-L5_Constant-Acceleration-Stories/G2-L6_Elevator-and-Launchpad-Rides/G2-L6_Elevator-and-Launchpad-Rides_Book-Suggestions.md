# G2 Elevator and Launchpad Rides — Book Suggestions

These resources connect constant-acceleration physics to the control and safety culture of elevators, drop towers, and launch rides.

## Elevator Engineering and Safety
- *Elevator Mechanical Design* — Lubomír Janovský. Covers traction calculations, acceleration envelopes, and emergency braking design for modern lifts.
- *The Vertical Transportation Handbook* — George R. Strakosch. Explains ride profiles, comfort criteria, and control strategies that map directly to acceleration budgeting.

## Theme Ride Dynamics
- *Amusement Park Physics* — David Bak. Details how launch towers and drop rides tune acceleration pulses and harness load factors for thrill without injury.
- *Roller Coaster Engineering* — Alejandro Alonso. Highlights vertical launch case studies with plots of tension, acceleration, and braking distances.

## Monitoring and Testing
- *Practical Elevator Engineering: Inspection and Testing* — Gina Barney. Guides acceptance tests, deceleration measurement, and passenger comfort surveys that validate the equations in practice.
