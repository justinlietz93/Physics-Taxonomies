# F1 Constant Acceleration Stories — Book Suggestions

These titles help instructors and lab leads build reliable constant-acceleration demonstrations, from conceptual primers to instrumentation checklists.

## Introductory Foundations
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Offers clear derivations of constant-acceleration relations with worked ramp and free-fall problems.
- *Physics for Scientists and Engineers* — Randall D. Knight. Emphasizes motion graphs and problem-solving strategies for one-dimensional force plateaus.

## Laboratory Playbooks
- *Teaching Introductory Physics* — Arnold B. Arons. Breaks down common misconceptions about constant acceleration and provides inquiry sequences that reinforce $v = v_0 + at$ reasoning.
- *RealTime Physics: Active Learning Laboratories Module 1* — David R. Sokoloff, Priscilla W. Laws & Ronald K. Thornton. Supplies sensor-based labs that calibrate photogates and motion detectors for steady accelerations.

## Data Analysis and Instrumentation
- *An Introduction to Error Analysis* — John R. Taylor. Guides uncertainty propagation for timing and displacement measurements in constant-force trials.
- *Experimental Methods for Science and Engineering Students* — Les Kirkup. Covers motion-sensor alignment, numerical differentiation, and data smoothing tailored to constant-acceleration experiments.
