# P2 Particles & Rigid Bodies — Book Suggestions

These references help learners master discrete-body mechanics, from single-particle dynamics through full rigid-body motion and contact modeling.

## Core Treatments
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Balances particle trajectories, rigid-body rotation, and collision theory with problem-rich chapters.
- *An Introduction to Mechanics* — Kleppner & Kolenkow. Builds strong intuition for forces, momentum, and energy in particle systems before moving to rotational motion.

## Rigid-Body Focus
- *Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms* — Roy Featherstone. A computational view of spatial vector algebra, recursive dynamics, and constraint handling for robots and spacecraft.
- *Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics* — J.L. Meriam & L.G. Kraige. Provides clear derivations and applied examples of planar and 3D rigid-body motion, including impact and gyroscopic effects.

## Collisions & Contact Modeling
- *Impact Mechanics* — W.J. Stronge. Explores restitution, impulse, and energy partition in collisions across solids and granular media.
- *Nonholonomic Mechanics and Control* — A.M. Bloch. Introduces constraint forces, rolling contacts, and geometric control, connecting particle and rigid-body models.
