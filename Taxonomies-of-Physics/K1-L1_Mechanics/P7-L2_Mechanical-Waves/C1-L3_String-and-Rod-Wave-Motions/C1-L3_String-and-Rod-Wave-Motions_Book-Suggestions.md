# C1 String & Rod Wave Motions — Book Suggestions

String and rod waves translate tension and elasticity into propagating disturbances. These resources cover wave equations, boundary reflections, and laboratory analogs.

## Wave Basics
- *The Physics of Vibrations and Waves* — H. John Pain. Provides the 1D wave equation, boundary conditions, and dispersion discussions.
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Builds intuition for traveling, standing, and driven waves on strings and rods.

## Boundary Behavior
- *Fundamentals of Acoustics* — Kinsler, Frey, Coppens & Sanders. Covers impedance, reflection coefficients, and energy flux in rods and air columns.
- *Structural Acoustics* — Marshall Long. Explores coupled beam, plate, and acoustic modes relevant to rods with attachments.

## Experimental Toolkits
- *Experimental Physics: Modern Methods* — R.A. Dunlap. Offers interferometry and high-speed diagnostics for wave measurements.
- *Acoustics: An Introduction to Its Physical Principles* — Allan D. Pierce. Links laboratory setups to theoretical predictions for longitudinal and transverse waves.
