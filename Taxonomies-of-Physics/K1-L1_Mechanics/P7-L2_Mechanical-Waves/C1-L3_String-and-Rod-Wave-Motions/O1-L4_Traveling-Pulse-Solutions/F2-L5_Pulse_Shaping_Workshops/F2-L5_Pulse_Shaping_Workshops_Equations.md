# F2 Pulse Shaping Workshops â€” Core Equations

Pulse shaping workshops tailor the waveform through superposition and tension adjustments. These equations show how to design and predict engineered pulses on strings or rods.

## Fourier Pulse Synthesis
**Wave packet construction:**

$$y(x,t) = \int A(k) e^{i(kx - \omega t)} dk$$

- Choosing amplitude spectrum $A(k)$ sets the spatial profile and dispersion of synthesized pulses.

## Gaussian Wave Packet Width
**Dispersion estimate:**

$$\sigma_{x}(t) = \sqrt{\sigma_{x0}^{2} + \left(\frac{\partial^{2} \omega}{\partial k^{2}}\right)^{2} \frac{t^{2}}{4 \sigma_{x0}^{2}}}$$

- For weakly dispersive media, the packet width $\sigma_{x}(t)$ grows with the curvature of the dispersion relation $\omega(k)$, guiding tension and medium choices.

## Tension Tuning for Target Speed
**Adjusting wave speed:**

$$T = \mu v^{2}_{\text{target}}$$

- Setting tension $T$ based on desired pulse speed $v_{\text{target}}$ and linear density $\mu$ helps synchronize shaped pulses in demonstrations.
