# F2 Pulse Shaping Workshops — Book Suggestions

Pulse shaping workshops tap advanced wave references and laboratory guides. These books help instructors and engineers craft custom wave packets and control dispersion.

## Wave Packet Theory
- *Wave Motion in Elastic Solids* — Karl F. Graff. Discusses dispersion relations and wave packet evolution in rods and plates.
- *Waves in Layered Media* — Leonid Brekhovskikh & Oleg A. Godin. Covers Fourier synthesis and dispersion management in stratified systems.

## Experimental Wave Control
- *Vibration and Wave Control in Structures* — H. Benaroya, M. L. Nagarkar & W. Wei. Presents techniques for shaping pulses using actuators and tuned tensioning.
- *Experimental Techniques in Mechanical Engineering* — Steven R. Schmid & Katharine C. Baker. Includes labs on string pulse generation and instrumentation.

## Signal Processing Analogies
- *Signals and Systems* — Alan V. Oppenheim & Alan S. Willsky. Provides convolution and Fourier tools useful for designing mechanical pulse shapes.
- *Wavelets and Filter Banks* — Gilbert Strang & Truong Nguyen. Inspires multi-scale pulse design strategies using mechanical analogs of digital filters.
