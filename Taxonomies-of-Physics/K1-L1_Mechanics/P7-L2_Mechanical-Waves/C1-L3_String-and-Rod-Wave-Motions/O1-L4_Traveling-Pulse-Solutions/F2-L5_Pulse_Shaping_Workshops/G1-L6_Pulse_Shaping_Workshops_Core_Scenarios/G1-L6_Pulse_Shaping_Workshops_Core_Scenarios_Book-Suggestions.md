# G1 Pulse Shaping Workshops Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

To craft custom pulses, facilitators need guides on waveform synthesis and practical actuator techniques.

## Waveform Design References
- *Signals and Systems* — Oppenheim & Willsky. Introduces Fourier decompositions and pulse trains with accessible math.
- *Vibration with Control* — Daniel Inman. Discusses excitation shaping and bandwidth considerations for mechanical actuators.

## Lab and Outreach Guides
- *Make: Waves* — Mike Barela. Provides maker-friendly projects on generating and visualizing wave pulses using low-cost gear.
- *Active Learning in Optics and Photonics* — UNESCO. Although optics focused, its pulse lab structure adapts well to mechanical wave workshops.
