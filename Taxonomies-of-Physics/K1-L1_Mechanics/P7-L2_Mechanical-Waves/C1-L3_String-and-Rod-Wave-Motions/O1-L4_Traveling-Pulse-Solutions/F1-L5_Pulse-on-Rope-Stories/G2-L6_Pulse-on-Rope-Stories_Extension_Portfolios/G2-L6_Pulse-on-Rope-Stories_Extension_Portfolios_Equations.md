# G2 Pulse on Rope Stories Extension Portfolios â€” Core Equations

Extended activities send multiple pulses down ropes with varying tensions and attachments. These equations support timing analysis and superposition challenges.

## Superposition of Two Pulses
**Predicts overlap shapes.**

$$u(x, t) = u_{1}(x, t) + u_{2}(x, t)$$

- Because the wave equation is linear for small amplitudes, pulses add directly, allowing predictions of constructive or destructive interference.

## Phase Shift on Partial Reflection
**Handles ropes tied to heavier lines.**

$$R = \frac{Z_{2} - Z_{1}}{Z_{2} + Z_{1}}, \quad T = \frac{2 Z_{2}}{Z_{2} + Z_{1}}$$

- Reflection $R$ and transmission $T$ coefficients define amplitude and phase when connecting ropes of different impedances $Z$.

## Travel Time Between Markers
**Supports pulse racing games.**

$$t = \frac{d}{v} = d \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{T}}$$

- Distance $d$ between markers, tension $T$, and density $\mu$ set arrival times for pulses triggered at known intervals.

## Effective Tension with Hanging Mass
**Allows quick retuning during demos.**

$$T = m g + T_{0}$$

- When a mass $m$ hangs over a pulley, the baseline tension increases by $m g$ plus any pre-tension $T_{0}$, letting instructors tune speed on the fly.
