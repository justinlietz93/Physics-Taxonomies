# F1 Pulse on Rope Stories â€” Core Equations

Traveling pulses on strings are governed by wave speed and boundary reflections. These equations describe pulse shape and arrival timing for rope demonstrations.

## Wave Speed on a Taut String
**Linear density relation:**

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

- Pulse speed $v$ depends on string tension $T$ and linear mass density $\mu$, allowing quick predictions of travel time down a rope.

## D'Alembert Pulse Solution
**Right- and left-traveling components:**

$$y(x,t) = f(x - vt) + g(x + vt)$$

- The displacement at position $x$ combines forward and backward traveling pulses, capturing reflections from fixed or free ends.

## Reflected Pulse Inversion
**Fixed-end boundary:**

$$y(0,t) = 0 \Rightarrow g(-vt) = -f(-vt)$$

- A fixed boundary inverts the reflected pulse amplitude, guiding qualitative predictions for demonstrations with anchored ropes.
