# G1 Jump Rope and Slinky Pulses â€” Core Equations

Short, sharp pulses racing along ropes or slinkies reveal the fundamentals of wave motion. These relations help demonstrators predict pulse speed, shape, and reflection.

## Pulse Speed on a Tensioned Rope
**Sets how fast disturbances travel.**

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

- Tension $T$ and linear density $\mu$ control the speed; tightening the rope yields faster pulses for timing activities.

## Reflected Pulse Inversion
**Determines whether a pulse flips at a boundary.**

$$R = \frac{Z_{2} - Z_{1}}{Z_{2} + Z_{1}}$$

- Wave impedance $Z = \sqrt{T \mu}$ dictates reflection coefficient $R$; a fixed end ($Z_{2} \to \infty$) produces an inverted return pulse.

## Pulse Broadening from Damping
**Explains why pulses spread out.**

$$\tau(t) = \tau_{0} + \alpha t$$

- A simple linear growth of pulse width $\tau$ with time $t$ due to internal friction matches classroom observations of slinky pulses smearing out.

## Energy in a Pulse
**Links hand input to observed motion.**

$$E = \frac{1}{2} \mu v \int u^{2}(x) \, dx$$

- Integrating displacement profile $u(x)$ shows that larger amplitude flicks inject more energy, sustaining clearer pulses.
