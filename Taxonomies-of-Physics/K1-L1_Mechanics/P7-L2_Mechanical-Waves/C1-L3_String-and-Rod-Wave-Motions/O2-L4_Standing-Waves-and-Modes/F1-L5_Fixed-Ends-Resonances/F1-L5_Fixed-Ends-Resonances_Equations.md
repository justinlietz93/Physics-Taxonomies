# F1 Fixed Ends Resonances â€” Core Equations

Fixed-end resonances arise when standing waves fit integer half-wavelengths between supports. These equations give mode frequencies and node positions for string and rod demonstrations.

## Mode Shapes
**Displacement profile:**

$$y_{n}(x,t) = A \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \cos(\omega_{n} t)$$

- Mode number $n$ dictates the spatial sine profile between fixed ends separated by length $L$.

## Resonant Frequencies
**Harmonic series:**

$$f_{n} = \frac{n v}{2 L}$$

- Wave speed $v$ and span $L$ set the discrete resonance frequencies for each mode $n$.

## Node Spacing
**Position of nodes:**

$$x_{k} = \frac{k L}{n}, \quad k = 0,1,\ldots,n$$

- Nodes occur at equally spaced locations along the string, guiding placement of bridges or sensors.
