# G1 Guitar String and Air Column â€” Core Equations

Fixed-end strings and open air columns share harmonics that set musical pitch. These equations connect length, tension, and mode number to resonance frequency.

## Fundamental String Frequency
**Sets the base note.**

$$f_{1} = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

- String length $L$, tension $T$, and linear density $\mu$ determine the lowest frequency; fretting shortens $L$ to raise pitch.

## Harmonic Series
**Generates overtones.**

$$f_{n} = n f_{1}$$

- Integer multiples $n$ of the fundamental produce harmonics that shape timbre and support node demonstrations.

## Air Column Resonance (Open Tube)
**Matches string frequency to acoustic output.**

$$f_{n} = n \frac{c}{2L}$$

- Air column length $L$ and sound speed $c$ set resonant frequencies, explaining how guitars couple string vibrations to body cavities.
