# G2 Fixed Ends Resonances Extension Portfolios â€” Core Equations

Extended labs explore nonideal boundaries, damping, and coupled strings. These formulas broaden fixed-end resonance analysis.

## Effective Length with End Correction
**Accounts for finite bridge stiffness.**

$$L_{\text{eff}} = L + \Delta L$$

- Small extension $\Delta L = \frac{k_{b}}{k_{s}} L$ adjusts mode frequencies when supports flex with stiffness $k_{b}$ relative to string stiffness $k_{s}$.

## Damped Mode Frequency
**Includes energy loss.**

$$f_{d} = f_{n} \sqrt{1 - \zeta^{2}}$$

- Damping ratio $\zeta$ reduces the observed frequency compared to the undamped mode $f_{n}$, matching measured decay.

## Coupled String Splitting
**Explains beat patterns between adjacent strings.**

$$f_{\pm} = f_{0} \sqrt{1 \pm \kappa}$$

- Coupling coefficient $\kappa$ captures bridge interaction, yielding slightly split frequencies that cause beats.
