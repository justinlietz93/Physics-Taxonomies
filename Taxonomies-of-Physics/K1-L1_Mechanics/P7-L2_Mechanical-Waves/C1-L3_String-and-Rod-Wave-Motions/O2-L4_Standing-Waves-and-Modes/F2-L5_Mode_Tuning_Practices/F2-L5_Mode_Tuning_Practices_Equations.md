# F2 Mode Tuning Practices â€” Core Equations

Mode tuning adjusts tension, length, or mass distribution to lock resonances onto target frequencies. These equations guide practical tuning routines.

## Frequency Sensitivity to Tension
**Derivative form:**

$$\frac{\Delta f_{n}}{f_{n}} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta T}{T}$$

- A fractional change in tension produces half as much fractional change in mode frequency, helping set tuning increments.

## Effective Length Adjustment
**Slide bridge relation:**

$$f_{n} = \frac{n}{2} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \frac{1}{L_{\text{eff}}}$$

- Moving a bridge to shorten effective length $L_{\text{eff}}$ raises the resonance; this formula informs iterative adjustments.

## Added Mass Correction
**Frequency shift:**

$$f_{n}^{\text{new}} = f_{n}^{0} \sqrt{\frac{m}{m + m_{a}}}$$

- Attaching auxiliary mass $m_{a}$ to a string segment lowers the frequency, useful for fine-tuning or damping specific modes.
