# F2 Mode Tuning Practices — Book Suggestions

Mode tuning practice references combine acoustics, instrument design, and vibration control. These titles explain how to manipulate tension, length, and damping to hit target modes.

## Musical Acoustics and Instrument Design
- *The Physics of Musical Instruments* — Neville H. Fletcher & Thomas D. Rossing. Details how string tension, length, and mass influence resonant frequencies.
- *Fundamentals of Musical Acoustics* — Arthur H. Benade. Provides practical tuning insights and experimental techniques for stringed instruments.

## Structural Vibration Control
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Rao V. Dukkipati. Covers tuning, mode coupling, and damping adjustments applicable to engineering systems.
- *Vibration Control of Active Structures* — André Preumont. Discusses active and passive tuning strategies for suppressing unwanted modes.

## Practical Tuning Guides
- *The Art of Violin Making* — Chris Johnson & Roy Courtnall. Offers hands-on procedures for adjusting plate thickness and string tension to tune resonances.
- *Guitar Setup, Maintenance & Repair* — John LeVan. Provides step-by-step adjustments of string tension and scale length to achieve desired harmonics.
