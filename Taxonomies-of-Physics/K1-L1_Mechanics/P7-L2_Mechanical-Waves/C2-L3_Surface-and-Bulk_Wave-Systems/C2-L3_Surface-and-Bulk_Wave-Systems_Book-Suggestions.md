# C2 Surface & Bulk Wave Systems — Book Suggestions

Surface and bulk waves span seismology, water waves, and elastic solids. These books emphasize dispersion, mode conversion, and measurement across layered media.

## Surface Wave Guides
- *Waves in Layered Media* — Leonard J. Lewis & Malcolm C. J. Fisher. Analyzes Rayleigh, Love, and guided waves in stratified solids.
- *Water Waves* — J. J. Stoker. Classic treatment of gravity and capillary waves with dispersion theory.

## Bulk Propagation
- *Seismic Wave Propagation* — Anders Petersson & Björn Sjögreen. Covers P- and S-wave kinematics, attenuation, and numerical modeling.
- *Elastic Waves in Solids* — Daniel Royer & Eugène Dieulesaint. Derives Christoffel equations, anisotropy effects, and non-destructive evaluation applications.

## Applications
- *Nonlinear Ocean Waves* — D. Henry. Connects envelope solitons, modulational instability, and coastal processes.
- *Ultrasonic Waves in Solid Media* — Joseph L. Rose. Applies guided and bulk wave analysis to flaw detection and material characterization.
