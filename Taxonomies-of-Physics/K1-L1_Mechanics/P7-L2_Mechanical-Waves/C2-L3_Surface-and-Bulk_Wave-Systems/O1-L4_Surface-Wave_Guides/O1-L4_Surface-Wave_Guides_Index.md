# O1-L4_Surface-Wave_Guides — Order Index
**Definition:** Focuses on tools that shepherd waves trapped near surfaces so they carry energy where we want.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Shallow-Water_Rollers** — Tracks gentle depth changes that amplify or calm shoreline waves.
- **F2-L5_Rayleigh-and-Love_Workups** — Tunes ground and plate properties to manage surface seismic ripples.
