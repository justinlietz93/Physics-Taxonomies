# O1 Surface Wave Guides — Book Suggestions

Surface-guided waves serve sensing, communication, and structural diagnostics. These books explore their physics, modeling, and applied design.

## Surface and Guided Wave Theory
- *Surface Acoustic Wave Devices in Telecommunications* — Colin Campbell. Introduces Rayleigh waves, dispersion control, and device architectures for surface wave propagation.
- *Guided Wave Optics and Photonic Devices* — Shyamal Bhattacharya & Mahua Ghosh. Provides mathematical tools for guiding waves along boundaries, adaptable to mechanical analogs.

## Structural and Geophysical Applications
- *Ultrasonic Guided Waves in Solid Media* — Joseph L. Rose. Comprehensive resource on Lamb and Rayleigh waves for nondestructive evaluation.
- *Seismic Surface Waves in a Laterally Inhomogeneous Earth* — Ivan P. Dobrynina. Examines how earth structures guide Rayleigh and Love waves, offering insight into dispersion and attenuation.

## Design and Signal Processing
- *Acoustic Wave Sensors: Theory, Design, and Physico-Chemical Applications* — D. S. Ballantine Jr. et al. Connects surface wave propagation to sensing platforms and signal interpretation.
- *Signal Processing and Data Analysis for Ultrasonic Guided Waves* — Tribikram Kundu. Details algorithms for extracting mode content and damage signatures from guided wave signals.
