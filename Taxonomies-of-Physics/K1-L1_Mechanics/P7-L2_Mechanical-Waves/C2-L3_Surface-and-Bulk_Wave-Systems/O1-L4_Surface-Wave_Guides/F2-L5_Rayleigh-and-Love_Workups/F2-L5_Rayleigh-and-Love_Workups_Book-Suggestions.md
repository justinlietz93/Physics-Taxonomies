# F2 Rayleigh and Love Workups — Book Suggestions

Rayleigh and Love wave workups require seismology and nondestructive evaluation texts. These references cover dispersion modeling and inversion techniques for guided surface waves.

## Seismology Foundations
- *An Introduction to Seismology, Earthquakes, and Earth Structure* — Seth Stein & Michael Wysession. Provides derivations and applications of surface wave dispersion.
- *Quantitative Seismology* — Keiiti Aki & Paul G. Richards. Offers rigorous treatments of Rayleigh and Love wave propagation in layered media.

## Nondestructive Evaluation
- *Ultrasonic Waves in Solid Media* — Joseph L. Rose. Discusses guided-wave modes, dispersion curves, and defect detection using Rayleigh and Love waves.
- *Nondestructive Evaluation of Materials by Infrared Thermography* — Xavier Maldague. Complements guided-wave diagnostics with surface energy flow analysis.

## Inversion and Data Processing
- *Seismic Surface Waves in Laterally Inhomogeneous Media* — V.V. Keilis-Borok. Covers inversion methods for retrieving layer properties from dispersion data.
- *Guided Waves in Structures for SHM* — Wieslaw Staszewski, Chun-Hung Wang & Michael F. B. Moreno (eds.). Presents case studies of Rayleigh and Love wave-based structural monitoring.
