# F1 Shallow Water Rollers — Book Suggestions

Shallow-water rollers draw from coastal engineering and hydraulics texts. These titles explain celerity, Froude regimes, and energy flux in guided surface waves.

## Coastal Hydrodynamics
- *Waves in Oceanic and Coastal Waters* — Leo H. Holthuijsen. Covers shallow-water wave behavior, energy transport, and breaking criteria.
- *Coastal Engineering Manual* — U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Provides design charts and empirical formulas for shoreline rollers and bores.

## Open Channel Flow
- *Open Channel Hydraulics* — Ven Te Chow. Discusses Froude number classification, hydraulic jumps, and surface wave propagation in channels.
- *Hydraulic Modelling: An Introduction* — Pavel Novak et al. Offers laboratory guidance for reproducing shallow-water rollers.

## Environmental and Surf Science
- *Surf Science: An Introduction to Waves for Surfing* — Tony Butt. Interprets shallow-water physics in accessible terms for surf zones.
- *Introduction to Nearshore Hydrodynamics* — Ib A. Svendsen. Focuses on wave shoaling, breaking, and roller formation near coasts.
