# F1 Shallow Water Rollers â€” Core Equations

Shallow-water rollers behave as surface gravity waves confined to channels. These equations estimate speed, nonlinearity, and energy transport for coastal and laboratory rollers.

## Shallow-Water Wave Speed
**Gravity control:**

$$c = \sqrt{g h}$$

- Wave celerity $c$ depends on gravitational acceleration $g$ and water depth $h$ when $h \ll \lambda$.

## Froude Number
**Nonlinearity indicator:**

$$Fr = \frac{U}{\sqrt{g h}}$$

- The ratio of flow speed $U$ to gravity wave speed distinguishes subcritical ($Fr < 1$) from supercritical rollers with hydraulic jumps.

## Energy Flux
**Per unit width:**

$$P = \frac{1}{2} \rho g a^{2} c$$

- Amplitude $a$, density $\rho$, and wave speed $c$ set the energy transported by shallow-water rollers, informing dissipation estimates.
