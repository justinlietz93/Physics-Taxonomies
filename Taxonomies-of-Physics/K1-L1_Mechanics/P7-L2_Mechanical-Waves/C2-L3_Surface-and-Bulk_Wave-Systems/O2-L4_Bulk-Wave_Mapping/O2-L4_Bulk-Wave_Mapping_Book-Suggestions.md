# O2 Bulk Wave Mapping — Book Suggestions

Bulk wave mapping supports nondestructive evaluation and geophysical imaging. These resources cover wave propagation, inversion algorithms, and instrumentation.

## Wave Propagation References
- *Ultrasonic Waves in Solid Media* — Joseph L. Rose. Presents wave equations, mode conversions, and attenuation needed for bulk inspections.
- *Quantitative Seismology* — Keiiti Aki & Paul G. Richards. Provides rigorous treatments of body waves, travel times, and amplitudes for subsurface imaging.

## Tomography and Inversion
- *Seismic Tomography: Theory and Practice* — H. M. Iyer & K. Hirahara. Explains travel-time inversion, filtered backprojection, and resolution analysis applicable to bulk wave mapping.
- *Inverse Problems in Geophysics* — Luigi Sagnotti. Offers mathematical foundations and computational strategies for reconstructing interior properties from wave data.

## Instrumentation and Data Processing
- *Ultrasonic Nondestructive Evaluation Systems* — Tribikram Kundu. Covers transducers, scanning systems, and signal processing for volumetric inspections.
- *Signal Analysis and Prediction* — A. B. Baggeroer & E. A. Robinson. Provides statistical methods for extracting wave arrivals and estimating attenuation in noisy environments.
