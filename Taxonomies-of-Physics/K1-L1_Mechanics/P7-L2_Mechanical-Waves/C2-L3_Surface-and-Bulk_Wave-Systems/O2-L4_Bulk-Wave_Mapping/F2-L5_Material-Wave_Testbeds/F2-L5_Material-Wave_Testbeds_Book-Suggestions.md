# F2 Material Wave Testbeds — Book Suggestions

Material wave testbeds draw from ultrasonics, nondestructive evaluation, and laboratory measurement handbooks. These resources detail attenuation mapping, transmission fixtures, and dispersion analysis.

## Ultrasonic Measurement Techniques
- *Ultrasonic Waves in Solid Media* — Joseph L. Rose. Provides experimental setups for measuring attenuation, transmission, and dispersion in solids.
- *Ultrasonic Testing* — Paul E. Mix. Covers practical considerations for probe selection, coupling, and signal interpretation in testbeds.

## Laboratory Handbooks
- *Experimental Methods for Engineers* — J.P. Holman. Discusses instrumentation, uncertainty analysis, and waveform processing relevant to wave testbeds.
- *Handbook of Nondestructive Evaluation* — Chuck Hellier. Offers application-specific guidance on ultrasonic inspection rigs and calibration blocks.

## Advanced Analysis References
- *Guided Wave Testing of Engineering Structures* — M.H. Aliabadi (ed.). Explores dispersion calculations and sensor networks for wave-based monitoring.
- *Acoustic Waves in Elastic Solids* — Karl F. Graff. Supplies theoretical backing for interpreting group velocity and mode conversions in laboratory data.
