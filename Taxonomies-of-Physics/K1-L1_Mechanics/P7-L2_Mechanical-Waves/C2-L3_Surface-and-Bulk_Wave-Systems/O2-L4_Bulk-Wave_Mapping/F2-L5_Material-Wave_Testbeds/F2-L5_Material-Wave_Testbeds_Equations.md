# F2 Material Wave Testbeds â€” Core Equations

Material wave testbeds quantify attenuation, transmission, and dispersion across specimens. These equations convert sensor readings into material property metrics.

## Exponential Attenuation
**Amplitude decay:**

$$A(x) = A_{0} e^{-\alpha x}$$

- Measuring amplitude $A(x)$ versus distance $x$ yields the attenuation coefficient $\alpha$ for bulk waves in the test specimen.

## Transmission Coefficient
**Interface evaluation:**

$$T = \frac{2 Z_{2}}{Z_{1} + Z_{2}}$$

- Acoustic impedances $Z_{1}, Z_{2}$ of adjacent media set transmitted amplitude ratios, informing couplant and fixture design.

## Group Velocity from Phase Data
**Dispersion analysis:**

$$v_{g} = \frac{d\omega}{dk}$$

- Differentiating angular frequency $\omega$ with respect to wavenumber $k$ recovers group velocity, allowing testbeds to map dispersive behavior across frequencies.
