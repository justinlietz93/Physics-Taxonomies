# F1 Longitudinal vs Shear Comparisons — Book Suggestions

Comparing longitudinal and shear waves requires solid mechanics and ultrasonics references. These works emphasize speed calculations, impedance, and polarization diagnostics.

## Elastic Wave Fundamentals
- *Elastic Waves in Solids* — Daniel Royer & Eugène Dieulesaint. Derives wave equations, speeds, and mode polarization in isotropic and anisotropic solids.
- *Mechanics of Solids and Materials* — Robert Asaro & Vlado Lubarda. Provides modulus relationships and wave propagation basics for structural materials.

## Ultrasonic Testing Guides
- *Ultrasonic Testing of Materials* — Josef Krautkrämer & Herbert Krautkrämer. Explains how longitudinal and shear modes are generated and detected in NDT settings.
- *Practical Ultrasonics* — David J. Hagemaier. Offers field techniques for distinguishing wave modes using probes and couplants.

## Applied Seismology and Geophysics
- *Introduction to Applied Geophysics* — Burger, Sheehan & Jones. Covers seismic P- and S-wave mapping for subsurface characterization.
- *Seismic Wave Propagation in Stratified Media* — Brian Kennett. Discusses mode conversions and impedance contrasts relevant to bulk-wave comparisons.
