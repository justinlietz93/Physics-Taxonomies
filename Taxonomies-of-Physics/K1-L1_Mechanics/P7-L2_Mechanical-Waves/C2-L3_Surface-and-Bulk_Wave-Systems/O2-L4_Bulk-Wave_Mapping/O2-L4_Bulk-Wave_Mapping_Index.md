# O2-L4_Bulk-Wave_Mapping — Order Index
**Definition:** Compares body-wave speeds and paths inside solids and fluids so designs avoid damaging resonance.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Longitudinal-vs-Shear_Comparisons** — Bench tests that contrast compression and shear travel times.
- **F2-L5_Material-Wave_Testbeds** — Full-scale rooms and rigs that tune wave paths through built structures.
