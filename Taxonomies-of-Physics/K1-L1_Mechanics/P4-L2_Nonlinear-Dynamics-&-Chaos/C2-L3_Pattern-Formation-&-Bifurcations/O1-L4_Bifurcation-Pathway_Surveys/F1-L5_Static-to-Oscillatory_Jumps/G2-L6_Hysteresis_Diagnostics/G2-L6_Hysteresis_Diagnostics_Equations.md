# G2 Hysteresis Diagnostics â€” Core Equations

Hysteresis reveals multistability and bistability. These equations quantify fold bifurcation sweeps, energy loops, and experimental protocols for identifying hysteresis in labs.

## Parameter Sweep for Fold Pair
**Tracks up- and down-branch transitions.**

$$\dot{x} = \mu - x^3 + x$$

- Sweeping $\mu$ upward and downward highlights different jump points, producing hysteresis loops when multiple equilibria coexist.

## Area of Hysteresis Loop
**Measures energy dissipated per cycle.**

$$A = \oint x \, d\mu$$

- Integrating around the loop quantifies work-like loss, useful for comparing hysteresis strength across systems.

## Critical Parameter Estimates
**Identify where stability changes.**

$$\mu_c = \pm \frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}$$

- For the cubic normal form, folds occur at these parameter values; experiments compare measured jump points to theory.
