# G2-L6_Granular_and_Vibrated_Landscapes — Genus Index
**Definition:** Vibrate grains or droplets so they self-sort into stripes, dunes, and standing waves.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Shaking-Sand_Wave-Bands** — Vibrate colored sand to watch standing stripes form.
- **S2-L7_Coffee_Ring_Spread_Audit** — Track drying coffee drops forming ringed deposits.
