# G2 Granular and Vibrated Landscapes â€” Core Equations

Vibrated granular layers create ripple and heap patterns analogous to convection murals. These equations cover dimensionless acceleration, pattern wavelength, and flux balances for landscape labs.

## Dimensionless Acceleration (Gamma)
**Controls onset of pattern formation.**

$$\Gamma = \frac{a_{\text{max}}}{g} = \frac{A (2\pi f)^2}{g}$$

- Peak vibrational acceleration $a_{\text{max}}$ relative to gravity determines when grains lift off and organize into patterns.

## Wavelength Scaling with Layer Depth
**Empirical relation for ripple spacing.**

$$\lambda \approx c h$$

- Ripple wavelength $\lambda$ scales with layer depth $h$; constant $c \approx 10$ for many granular media, guiding tray dimensions.

## Mass Flux Balance for Heap Growth
**Relates convection currents to heap angle.**

$$Q_{\text{up}} = Q_{\text{down}} = \rho v h$$

- Upward and downward fluxes balance at steady state, with density $\rho$, flow speed $v$, and layer depth $h$ setting heap slope and turnover rates.
