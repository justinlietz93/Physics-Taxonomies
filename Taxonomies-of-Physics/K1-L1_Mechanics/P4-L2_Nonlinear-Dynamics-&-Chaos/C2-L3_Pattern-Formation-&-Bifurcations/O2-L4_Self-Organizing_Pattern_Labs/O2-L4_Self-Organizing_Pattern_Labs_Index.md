# O2-L4_Self-Organizing_Pattern_Labs — Order Index
**Definition:** Experiment with nonlinear media that spontaneously paint spots, stripes, and rolls.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Reaction-Diffusion_Studios** — Mix chemicals and bio-mimics that grow Turing-like spots and stripes.
- **F2-L5_Convection-&-Flow_Murals** — Shape thermal and granular flows that self-arrange into rolls and waves.
