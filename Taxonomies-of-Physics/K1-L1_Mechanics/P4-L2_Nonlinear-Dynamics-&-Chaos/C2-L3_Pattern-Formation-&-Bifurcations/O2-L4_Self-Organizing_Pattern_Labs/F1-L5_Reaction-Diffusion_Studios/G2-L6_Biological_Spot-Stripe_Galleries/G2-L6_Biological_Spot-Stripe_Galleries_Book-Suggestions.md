- *Morphogenesis and Pattern Formation in Biological Systems* — R. Takaki. Provides mathematical models for pigment and coat patterns.

## Reaction-Diffusion in Biology
- *Pattern Formation in Morphogenesis* — V. Capasso. Discusses reaction-diffusion mechanisms across species with parameter estimates.
- *Animal Color Patterns* — T. Sekimura. Links genetic regulation to Turing-like models.

## Imaging and Data Analysis
- *Biological Imaging* — Donald B. Hackett. Offers methods for quantifying spot and stripe spacing from photographs.
