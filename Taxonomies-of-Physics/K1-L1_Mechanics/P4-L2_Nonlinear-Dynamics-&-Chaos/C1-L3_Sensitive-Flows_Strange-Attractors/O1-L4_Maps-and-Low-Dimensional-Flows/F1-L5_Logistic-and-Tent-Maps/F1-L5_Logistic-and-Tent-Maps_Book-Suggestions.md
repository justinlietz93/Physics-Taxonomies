# F1 Logistic and Tent Maps — Book Suggestions

These titles build intuition for one-dimensional maps, cobweb diagrams, and universality in period-doubling cascades.

## Accessible Introductions
- *Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics* — Robert C. Hilborn. Explains logistic and tent map behavior with clear graphics and labs.
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven H. Strogatz. Provides approachable discussions and exercises on iterated maps and bifurcations.

## Mathematical Deep Dives
- *One-Dimensional Dynamics* — Welington de Melo & Sebastian van Strien. Offers rigorous proofs on interval maps, invariant measures, and structural stability.
- *Universality in Chaos* — P. Cvitanović et al. Collects classic papers on period doubling, Feigenbaum constants, and renormalization for maps.

## Computational and Experimental Resources
- *Exploring Chaos: Theory and Experiment* — Brian Davies. Provides computer labs and experiment ideas for logistic and tent maps.
- *An Exploration of Dynamical Systems and Chaos* — John H. Hubbard & Beverly H. West. Mixes theoretical explanations with interactive labs on cobwebbing and parameter sweeps.
