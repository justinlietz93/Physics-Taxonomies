# G1 Cobwebbing Workshops Core Scenarios â€” Core Equations

Cobweb plots visualize iterative maps by alternating vertical and horizontal moves. These equations define the iteration geometry and slope tests teachers use in workshops.

## Iteration Step via Cobweb
**Maps successive points graphically.**

$$x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$$

- Participants draw a vertical line to $(x_n, f(x_n))$ then horizontal to the diagonal, embodying the algebraic update visually.

## Slope Test at Fixed Points
**Predicts cobweb convergence or divergence.**

$$|f'(x^*)| < 1 \Rightarrow \text{cobweb spirals inward}$$

- If the slope magnitude at intersection with $y=x$ is below one, the cobweb converges; above one it repels, guiding prediction of workshop outcomes.

## Period-2 Orbit Detection
**Uses second iterate to spot two-cycles.**

$$f(f(x)) = x$$

- Plotting $f^{(2)}(x)$ alongside $y=x$ reveals period-2 intersections; cobwebbing around them shows alternating points.
