# C1 Sensitive Flows & Strange Attractors — Book Suggestions

Sensitive flows reveal how small perturbations grow into wildly different outcomes. These resources develop phase-space intuition, Lyapunov diagnostics, and experimental realizations of chaotic attractors.

## Chaos Foundations
- *Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics* — Robert C. Hilborn. Introduces sensitive dependence, logistic maps, and strange attractors with laboratory analogies.
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven H. Strogatz. Provides geometric reasoning, bifurcation diagrams, and hands-on examples that ground the class vocabulary.

## Lyapunov & Fractal Tools
- *Deterministic Chaos: An Introduction* — Heinz Georg Schuster & Wolfram Just. Explains Lyapunov spectra, invariant measures, and correlation dimensions used to classify strange attractors.
- *Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws* — Manfred Schroeder. Connects fractal geometry, attractor dimension, and power-law statistics evident in sensitive flows.

## Experimental Narratives
- *Chaos: Making a New Science* — James Gleick. Tells the experimental history of Lorenz, Rössler, and fluid convection that turned chaos into a practical toolkit.
- *The Essence of Chaos* — Edward N. Lorenz. Uses weather models and convection rolls to showcase sensitive dependence in real flows.
