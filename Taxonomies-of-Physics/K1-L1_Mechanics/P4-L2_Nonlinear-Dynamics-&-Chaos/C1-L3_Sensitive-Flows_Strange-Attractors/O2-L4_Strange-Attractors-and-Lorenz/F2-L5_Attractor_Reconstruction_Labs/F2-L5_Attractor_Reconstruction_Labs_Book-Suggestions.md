# F2 Attractor Reconstruction Labs — Book Suggestions

These books focus on time-series reconstruction, embedding, and chaos identification techniques essential for attractor labs.

## Embedding Theory and Practice
- *Practical Bifurcation and Stability Analysis* — Randal C. Allen. Offers tutorials on delay embeddings, false nearest neighbors, and Lyapunov estimation.
- *Time Series Analysis in Meteorology and Climatology* — Claude Duchon & Robert Hale. Demonstrates embedding-based reconstructions in atmospheric data.

## Nonlinear Time-Series Analysis
- *Nonlinear Time Series Analysis* — Holger Kantz & Thomas Schreiber. Standard reference for correlation dimension, mutual information, and predictability metrics.
- *Applied Nonlinear Time Series Analysis: Applications in Physics, Physiology and Finance* — Michael Small. Provides case studies with step-by-step reconstruction workflows.

## Software and Laboratory Guides
- *Chaos Data Analyzer: The Professional Version* — James S. Bassingthwaighte et al. Documents software tools for embedding, Lyapunov estimation, and surrogate testing.
- *Practical Time Series Forecasting with R* — Galit Shmueli & Kenneth C. Lichtendahl Jr. Includes tutorials on delay plots and attractor visualizations using open-source software.
