# P1 Energy Landscapes & Variational Principles — Book Suggestions

This phylum dives into how trajectories emerge from shaped potentials and extremal rules. The titles below emphasize intuitive energy pictures, rigorous variational calculus, and computational explorations that map rugged landscapes.

## Foundational Texts
- *Mechanics* — L.D. Landau & E.M. Lifshitz. Concise derivations of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms that ground energy landscapes with symmetry insights.
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein, Charles Poole, & John Safko. Exhaustive treatment of variational calculus, canonical transformations, and conserved quantities.

## Applied & Geometric Views
- *Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry* — Jerrold E. Marsden & Tudor Ratiu. Shows how geometry, reduction, and symmetry carve energy surfaces and conserved currents.
- *Variational Principles in Physics* — Jean-Louis Basdevant & Jean Dalibard. Connects action principles to optics, quantum, and statistical mechanics, reinforcing landscape analogies.

## Computational & Landscape Explorations
- *The Art of Molecular Dynamics Simulation* — D. C. Rapaport. Demonstrates how energy landscapes guide numerical integration, barrier hopping, and constrained motion.
- *Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds* — P.-A. Absil, R. Mahony, & R. Sepulchre. Extends gradient flows and variational ideas to curved spaces relevant for robotics and control classes.
