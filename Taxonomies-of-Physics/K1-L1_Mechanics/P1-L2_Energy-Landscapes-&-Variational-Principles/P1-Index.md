# P1–L2 Energy Landscapes & Variational Principles
**Definition:** Treat dynamics as motion across a landscape: valleys hold equilibria, ridges block transitions, and action scores pick the “least effort” path.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- **C1-L3_Shapes-of-Potential_Wells-Peaks-Saddles** — catalog the geometry of wells, peaks, saddles, and flat spots.
- **C2-L3_Small-Oscillations_Local-Bowl-as-Spring** — linearize near a minimum and treat it as a harmonic oscillator.
- **C3-L3_Barriers-Activation-and-Escape** — study how systems surmount ridges with pushes or noise.
- **C4-L3_Bistability-Switching-and-Hysteresis** — track memory when two valleys compete across a barrier.
- **C5-L3_Conservative-vs-Nonconservative-Forces** — contrast pure gradients with extra pushes and drags.
- **C6-L3_Dissipation-and-Gradient-Descent** — watch frictional flows slide downhill to rest.
- **C7-L3_Effective-Potentials_Rotating-Frames-and-Constraints** — reshape landscapes when frames or constraints add terms.
- **C8-L3_Constraints-and-Lagrange_Conceptual** — enforce rails and joints via multipliers in the energy story.
- **C9-L3_Variational-Principles-and-Least-Action_Conceptual** — score entire paths and pick stationary action routes.
- **C10-L3_Bifurcations-and-Catastrophes** — follow how minima appear, merge, or vanish as knobs are tuned.
- **C11-L3_Optimization-Landscapes** — borrow physics intuition to navigate high-dimensional cost surfaces.
