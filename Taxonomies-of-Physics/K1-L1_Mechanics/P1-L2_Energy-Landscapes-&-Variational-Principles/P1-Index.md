# P1–L2 Energy Landscapes & Variational Principles

**Definition**: A mental terrain where “height” measures how favorable a state is. Systems roll **downhill** toward valleys (stable states); ridges are **barriers**; saddles are **passes** between valleys. With friction, downhill turns height into heat; with a shove or noise, you can hop to a new valley.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Classes (canonical models)

- **C1-L3_Shapes-of-Potential_Wells-Peaks-Saddles** — name the terrain features; valleys = stable, peaks = unstable, saddles = gateways.
- **C2-L3_Small-Oscillations_Local-Bowl-as-Spring** — near a minimum, the bowl behaves like a spring; gentle wiggles about equilibrium.
- **C3-L3_Barriers-Activation-and-Escape** — switching valleys needs a ridge crossing; deliberate push or random kicks.
- **C4-L3_Bistability-Switching-and-Hysteresis** — two valleys + a ridge give memory; sweeping a knob leads to stickiness.
- **C5-L3_Conservative-vs-Nonconservative-Forces** — slopes define forces (conservative); friction/driving break single-landscape descriptions.
- **C6-L3_Dissipation-and-Gradient-Descent** — friction slides you downhill; steeper slopes relax faster.
- **C7-L3_Effective-Potentials_Rotating-Frames-and-Constraints** — viewpoint/rotation/constraints reshape the perceived terrain.
- **C8-L3_Constraints-and-Lagrange_Conceptual** — rails/strings restrict motion to allowed paths; a tidy way to account for them.
- **C9-L3_Variational-Principles-and-Least-Action_Conceptual** — of all paths, the realized one makes a “score” stationary; the terrain-in-path-space view.
- **C10-L3_Bifurcations-and-Catastrophes** — as a knob turns, valleys appear/merge/disappear; sudden state changes.
- **C11-L3_Optimization-Landscapes** — physics ↔ search; gradient descent is sliding downhill on a rugged terrain.
- **C12-L3_Stochastic-Landscapes-and-Noise-Driven-Dynamics** — noise perturbs the terrain; rare escapes set long timescales.
