# F2 Noise Tailoring Techniques — Book Suggestions

Use these resources to shape noise environments for barrier-crossing control in mechanical, electronic, and chemical systems.

## Noise Engineering Fundamentals
- *An Introduction to Stochastic Processes in Physics* — Don S. Lemons. Supplies practical treatments of colored noise, correlation times, and response functions.
- *Noise and Fluctuations: An Introduction* — D. K. C. MacDonald. Details spectral densities, measurement strategies, and links to effective temperatures.

## Control-Oriented Perspectives
- *Stochastic Resonance: An Introduction* — Luca Gammaitoni et al. Explains how tuned noise boosts switching and signal detection, with engineering case studies.
- *Random Perturbation Methods with Applications in Science and Engineering* — Anatoly Neishtadt & Sergei Tikhomirov. Covers asymptotic tools for controlled noise injections and escape modulation.

## Experimental Platforms and Applications
- *Noise in Nanoelectronic Devices* — Fabrizio Bonani & Giovanni Ghione. Connects tailored fluctuations to switching reliability in nanoscale circuits.
- *Micro- and Nanoscale Phenomena in Tribology* — J. A. Williams & H. Zaidi. Discusses frictional noise, thermal control, and escape suppression strategies in contact mechanics.
