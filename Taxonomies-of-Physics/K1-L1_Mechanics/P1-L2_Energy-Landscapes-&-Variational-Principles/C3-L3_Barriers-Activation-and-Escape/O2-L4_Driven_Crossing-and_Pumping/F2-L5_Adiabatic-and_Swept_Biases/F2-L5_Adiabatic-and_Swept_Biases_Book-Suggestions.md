# F2 Adiabatic and Swept Biases — Book Suggestions

These works help practitioners plan slow tilts, ramps, and sweeps that shepherd systems across disappearing barriers.

## Adiabatic Dynamics Foundations
- *Adiabatic Evolution of Linear Systems* — Alexander Neishtadt. Covers quasistatic invariants and critical sweep rates in dissipative and Hamiltonian settings.
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven H. Strogatz. Provides clear discussions of slow parameter variation, bifurcations, and escape timing.

## Engineering Ramps and Bias Control
- *Time-Dependent Switching in Superconducting Devices* — Michele Cirillo & Carlo Granata. Details adiabatic sweeps, ramp shaping, and detection of escape in Josephson circuits.
- *Energy Harvesting and Dissipation in Micro-Mechanical Systems* — S. Beeby & N. White. Addresses bias scheduling, damping management, and controlled release in MEMS.

## Reliability and Testing Protocols
- *Reliability Physics and Engineering* — J. W. McPherson. Links bias ramp stress methods to activation energy extraction and lifetime planning.
- *Temperature Accelerated Dynamics* — Arthur F. Voter (Annual Review). Discusses controlled parameter sweeps and thermally assisted escape algorithms for materials modeling.
