# O2 Driven Crossing and Pumping — Book Suggestions

External drives reshape escape statistics by modulating barriers and injecting energy coherently. These references focus on resonant activation, time-dependent potentials, and experimental pumping schemes.

## Time-Dependent Potentials
- *Driven Diffusive Systems* — B. Derrida & J.L. Lebowitz (in *Physics Reports*). Surveys barrier crossing under periodically modulated landscapes.
- *Nonequilibrium Statistical Physics* — Gerd Röpke. Provides tools for handling time-dependent potentials, linear response, and pumping protocols.

## Resonant Activation & Stochastic Resonance
- *Stochastic Resonance: From Ice Ages to Crayfish* — R. Benzi & A. Sutera. Connects barrier crossings in periodically forced systems to resonant activation and noise synergy.
- *Applied Nonlinear Dynamics* — Nayfeh & Balachandran. Supplies analytical and numerical strategies for driven bistable and escape problems.

## Experimental Implementations
- *Dynamics of Josephson Junctions and Circuits* — Likharev. Demonstrates microwave-driven escape and phase locking in superconducting circuits.
- *Optically Trapped Particles and Fluids* — A. Ashkin. Describes modulated optical landscapes where barrier heights are tuned in time to pump colloids and biomolecules.
