# S2-L7_Clothes_Iron_Auto-Shutoff — Species Index
**Definition:** The thermostat disc inside a clothes iron that clicks power off if the soleplate overheats.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- The bimetal disc senses the soleplate temperature and flips once the safe limit is exceeded.
- Its snap pushes a linkage that separates the power contacts feeding the heater.
- Cooling or a manual reset allows the disc to pop back, closing the circuit to resume ironing.
