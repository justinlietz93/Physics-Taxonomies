# F2-L5_Fluidic_Pressure-and-Level_Controls — Family Index
**Definition:** Diaphragms and floats that change state at different rising versus falling levels to manage pumps and compressors.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Genus (L6) — index
- **G1-L6_Pressure_Switch_Diaphragms** — flexible membranes and springs that toggle pump relays between cut-in and cut-out setpoints.
- **G2-L6_Float_Valve_Latches** — levered floats that latch pumps or valves based on tank level bands.
