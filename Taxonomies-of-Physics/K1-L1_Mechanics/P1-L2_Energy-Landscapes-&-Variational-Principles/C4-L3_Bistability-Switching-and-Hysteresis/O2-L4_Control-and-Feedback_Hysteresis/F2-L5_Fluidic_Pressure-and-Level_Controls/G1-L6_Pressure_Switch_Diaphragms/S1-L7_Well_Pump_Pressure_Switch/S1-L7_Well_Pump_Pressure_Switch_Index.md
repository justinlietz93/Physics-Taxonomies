# S1-L7_Well_Pump_Pressure_Switch — Species Index
**Definition:** A diaphragm switch that starts and stops a household well pump between lower and upper water-pressure setpoints.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Rising water pressure pushes a diaphragm and spring toward the shutoff detent.
- At the cut-out point the linkage snaps, opening the pump relay and letting pressure fall.
- Dropping pressure relaxes the spring until the mechanism snaps back, restarting the pump at the cut-in level.
