# S2-L7_Air_Compressor_Cut-In_Cut-Out — Species Index
**Definition:** The diaphragm pressure switch on a garage compressor that toggles the motor between low and high tank pressures.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Tank pressure pushes on a diaphragm against an adjustable spring stack.
- When the high setpoint is reached the linkage snaps, opening the motor contactor.
- As air is used the diaphragm relaxes until the mechanism snaps back, restarting the compressor at the low threshold.
