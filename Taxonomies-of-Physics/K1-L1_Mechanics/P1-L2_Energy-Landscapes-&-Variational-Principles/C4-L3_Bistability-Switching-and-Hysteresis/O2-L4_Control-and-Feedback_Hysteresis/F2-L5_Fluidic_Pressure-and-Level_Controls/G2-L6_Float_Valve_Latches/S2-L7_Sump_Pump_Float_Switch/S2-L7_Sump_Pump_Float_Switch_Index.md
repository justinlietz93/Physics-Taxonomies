# S2-L7_Sump_Pump_Float_Switch — Species Index
**Definition:** A tethered float switch that kicks a sump pump on when water rises high and off after the basin clears.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Rising water lifts the float until gravity torque flips an internal mercury or reed switch closed.
- The pump runs until water falls enough that the float swings back down.
- The travel gap between on and off heights keeps the pump from short-cycling with ripples.
