# O2 Control and Feedback Hysteresis — Book Suggestions

Control loops interacting with bistable elements create rate-dependent switching and loop-shaping challenges. These books combine hysteresis modeling, feedback design, and actuator case studies.

## Hysteresis Modeling
- *Hysteresis in Magnetism and Control* — Giorgio Bertotti & Isaak Mayergoyz. Builds Preisach and differential models that transfer directly to mechanical and ferroelectric systems.
- *Modeling Hysteresis* — Mayergoyz. Offers mathematical tools for capturing rate effects and inverse compensation schemes.

## Control Design with Hysteresis
- *Nonlinear Systems* — Hassan K. Khalil. Covers describing functions and Lyapunov tools for systems with hysteretic nonlinearities.
- *Applied Nonlinear Control* — Slotine & Li. Provides practical feedback designs, including relay and hysteresis controllers for mechanical systems.

## Applications and Compensation
- *Smart Material Systems and MEMS* — Vijay K. Varadan, K.J. Vinoy, & S. Gopalakrishnan. Demonstrates hysteresis compensation in piezoelectric actuators and shape-memory devices.
- *Control of Hysteretic Systems* — Hebertt Sira-Ramírez & Sunil Kumar Agrawal. Details inverse Preisach, adaptive, and sliding-mode strategies tailored for rate-dependent loops.
