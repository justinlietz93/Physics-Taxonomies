# O3 Field-Driven Bistable Media — Book Suggestions

When fields such as electric, magnetic, or thermal loads trigger bistable switching, cross-disciplinary resources become essential. These books connect continuum models to experiments in soft matter, magnetics, and ferroics.

## Ferroic and Magnetic Systems
- *Ferroelectric Memories* — J.F. Scott. Details polarization switching, hysteresis loops, and field-driven domain dynamics.
- *Classical and Quantum Magnetism* — R. Rado & H. Suhl. Covers magnetic hysteresis and switching, including Stoner–Wohlfarth models relevant to bistable media.

## Soft Matter & Elastomers
- *Soft Active Materials* — Shengqiang Cai & Zhigang Suo. Explores electrically driven elastomers with bistable stretching states.
- *Electroactive Polymer Actuators* — Kwang J. Kim & Satoshi Tadokoro. Provides design strategies for field-driven snap-through in polymeric membranes.

## Multiphysics Coupling
- *Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics* — Ellad B. Tadmor & Ronald E. Miller. Offers constitutive frameworks for coupled field–mechanical responses.
- *Smart Material Systems: Model Development* — Andreas Öchsner & Holm Altenbach. Presents coupled PDE models and simulation workflows for field-responsive bistable structures.
