# S2-L7_ReRAM_Bit_Element — Species Index
**Definition:** A resistive RAM cell that writes a conductive filament for logic “1” and ruptures it for logic “0”.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- A set pulse drives ions to form a conductive filament, leaving the cell in a low-resistance state.
- A reset pulse reverses the bias, dissolving the filament so resistance jumps high.
- The structure stays latched until another programming pulse toggles it again.
