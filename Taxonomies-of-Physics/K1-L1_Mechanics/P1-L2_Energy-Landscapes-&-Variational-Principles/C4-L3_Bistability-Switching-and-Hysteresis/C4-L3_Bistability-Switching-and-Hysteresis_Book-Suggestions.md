# C4 Bistability, Switching & Hysteresis — Book Suggestions

Bistable landscapes explain why systems snap between two favored states and remember their past. These readings balance potential-shape intuition with the tools needed to model switching thresholds and loop areas.

## Conceptual Foundations
- *The Physics of Bistability* — P. McClintock & F. Moss (eds.). Essays that trace double-well motifs from mechanical snaps to electronic circuits, highlighting noise-triggered switching and hysteresis memory.
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven Strogatz. Chapters on multistable fixed points and bifurcations build the qualitative map used to label bistable orders and families.

## Modeling & Analysis
- *Energy Harvesting: Autonomous Bistable Systems* — M. I. Friswell et al. Demonstrates how to parameterize energy wells, switching thresholds, and dissipative losses in mechanical and electromechanical designs.
- *Hysteresis in Magnetism* — Giorgio Bertotti. Provides quantitative frameworks for loop construction, coercive fields, and Preisach-style decompositions that generalize to any hysteretic landscape.

## Experimental & Applied Perspectives
- *Bistable Mechanisms: From Theory to Practice* — Byron M. Roth. Design-oriented treatment of compliant structures, showing how to tune curvature and barrier height for reliable switching.
- *Memristors and Neuromorphic Hardware* — Alex Nugent. Surveys hysteretic device physics and switching protocols for memory and neuromorphic applications, anchoring the abstract class concepts in contemporary devices.
