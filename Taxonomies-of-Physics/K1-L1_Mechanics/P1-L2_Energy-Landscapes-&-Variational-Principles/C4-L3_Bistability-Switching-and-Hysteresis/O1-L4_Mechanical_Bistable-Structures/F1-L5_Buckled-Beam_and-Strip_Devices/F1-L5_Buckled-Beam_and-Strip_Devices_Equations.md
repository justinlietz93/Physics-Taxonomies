# F1 Buckled Beam and Strip Devices — Core Equations

Buckled beams realize bistable energy wells used in switches and deployable devices. These formulas summarize critical loads, post-buckling shapes, and energy barriers.

## Euler Buckling Threshold
**Critical compressive load:**

$$P_{\text{cr}} = \frac{\pi^{2} E I}{L^{2}}$$

- For pinned–pinned beams, axial load $P$ exceeding $P_{\text{cr}}$ triggers symmetric buckled equilibria; $E I$ captures bending stiffness.

## Post-Buckling Shape Approximation
**Mode-1 deflection:**

$$w(x) = A \sin \left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right)$$

- Amplitude $A$ parameterizes the two stable configurations; sign of $A$ labels each well in the double-well potential landscape.

## Energy Landscape
**Effective double-well:**

$$U(A) = \frac{1}{2} k_{\text{eff}} (A^{2} - A_{0}^{2})^{2}$$

- Expansion of strain energy near buckling yields two minima at $\pm A_{0}$ separated by barrier height $\frac{1}{2} k_{\text{eff}} A_{0}^{4}$, governing snap-through switching.
