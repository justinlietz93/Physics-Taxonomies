# S1-L7_Retractable_Tape-Measure_Blade — Species Index
**Definition:** A curved steel measuring blade that snaps straight when pulled and recoils into a coil when released.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Cold-rolled steel gives the blade a natural curl with two stable radii.
- Pulling it over a surface forces the strip through a flat over-center configuration.
- Once the bend passes the midpoint, residual stress snaps it back and the spring reel helps rewind.
