# F1-L5_Buckled-Beam_and-Strip_Devices — Family Index
**Definition:** Slender bands that bow into two preferred arcs, letting handheld tools and wearables stay coiled or straight on demand.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Genus (L6) — index
- **G1-L6_Curled_Measuring_Tapes** — hardened steel ribbons that pop between flat and coiled storage shapes.
- **G2-L6_Slap_Bracelet_Strips** — spring-tempered bands that wrap around limbs when released from a flat state.
