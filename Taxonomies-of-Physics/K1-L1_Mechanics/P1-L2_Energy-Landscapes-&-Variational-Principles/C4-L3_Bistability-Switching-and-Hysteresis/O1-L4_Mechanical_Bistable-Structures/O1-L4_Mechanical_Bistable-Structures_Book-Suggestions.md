# O1 Mechanical Bistable Structures — Book Suggestions

Mechanical bistability converts stored elastic energy into snap-through motion. These references balance structural design, analytical models, and deployable-device case studies.

## Elastic Snap-Through Fundamentals
- *Nonlinear Solid Mechanics* — Gerhard A. Holzapfel. Covers elastic energy landscapes and the criteria for multiple stable equilibria.
- *Stability of Structures* — Zdeněk P. Bažant & Luigi Cedolin. Derives the load–deflection curves and bifurcations responsible for snap-through shells and arches.

## Design and Applications
- *Bistable Mechanisms* — Ashok Ambekar. Provides practical guidelines for designing compliant and rigid-link bistable devices.
- *Deployable Structures* — Sergio Pellegrino & Shaun Guest. Highlights aerospace and architectural implementations of bistable morphing components.

## Experimental Diagnostics
- *Experimental Methods in Mechanical Engineering* — J.P. Holman. Outlines instrumentation for measuring load–displacement hysteresis loops and snap-through forces.
- *Mechanics of Smart and Micro-Mechanical Systems* — C.R. Fuller & A. Tiwari. Presents micro-scale bistable actuators and MEMS switches that exhibit mechanical snap-through.
