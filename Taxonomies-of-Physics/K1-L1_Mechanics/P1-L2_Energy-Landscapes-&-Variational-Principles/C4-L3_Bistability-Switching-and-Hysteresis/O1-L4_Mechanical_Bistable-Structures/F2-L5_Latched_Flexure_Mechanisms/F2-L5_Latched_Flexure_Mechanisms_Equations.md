# F2 Latched Flexure Mechanisms — Core Equations

Latch-style flexures use tailored stiffness curves to hold two equilibrium positions. These equations summarize moment–curvature relations and snap-through criteria for compliant latches.

## Moment–Curvature Relation
**Planar flexure bending:**

$$M(s) = E I \kappa(s)$$

- Along arc-length $s$, bending moment $M$ is proportional to curvature $\kappa$; distributed compliance defines stored elastic energy in the flexure.

## Load–Deflection Characteristic
**Nonlinear force–displacement:**

$$F(x) = k_{1} x - k_{3} x^{3}$$

- Cubic softening term $k_{3}$ creates negative stiffness region; equilibria at $F=0$ define latched states separated by unstable midpoint.

## Snap-Through Criterion
**Energy release condition:**

$$\Delta U = U_{\text{unstable}} - U_{\text{latched}} = 0$$

- External trigger must supply energy equal to the barrier between stable and unstable equilibria for the flexure to snap into the alternate position.
