# F2 Velocity-Level and Nonholonomic Cases — Book Suggestions

These references focus on nonholonomic mechanics, velocity-level constraints, and rolling contact examples.

## Theoretical Foundations
- *Nonholonomic Mechanics and Control* — Anthony Bloch. Comprehensive treatment of Pfaffian constraints and geometric structure.
- *Geometric Control of Mechanical Systems* — Francesco Bullo & Andrew D. Lewis. Explores distributions, accessibility, and examples from robotics.

## Applications and Case Studies
- *The Mechanics of Rigid Bodies* — Jan Awrejcewicz. Includes nonholonomic rolling, sliding, and constraint examples.
- *Classical Mechanics with Maple* — Hernán C. Corben & Philip Stehle (updated by George Mayer). Demonstrates computer-algebra solutions for nonholonomic systems.

## Robotics and Vehicles
- *Planning Algorithms* — Steven M. LaValle. Discusses motion planning under nonholonomic constraints for wheeled robots.
- *Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots* — Roland Siegwart, Illah Nourbakhsh & Davide Scaramuzza. Covers differential-drive and car-like nonholonomic models.
