# F1 Symmetry-Aligned Coordinates — Book Suggestions

These references teach how to select generalized coordinates that respect symmetry and simplify dynamics.

## Analytical Mechanics
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Louis N. Hand & Janet D. Finch. Explains coordinate choices and cyclic variables in detail.
- *Classical Mechanics: Systems of Particles and Hamiltonian Dynamics* — Walter Greiner. Highlights symmetry-driven coordinate transformations.

## Symmetry and Conservation Laws
- *Noether's Theorem and Symmetry* — Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach. Connects symmetry-aligned coordinates to conserved quantities.
- *Geometric Mechanics* — Darryl D. Holm. Presents differential-geometric insight into coordinate reductions.

## Applied Examples
- *Advanced Engineering Dynamics* — Jerry Ginsberg. Demonstrates symmetry-based coordinates for rotating machinery and linkages.
- *Molecular Vibrations* — Wilson, Decius & Cross. Uses symmetry coordinates to simplify vibrational analysis of molecules.
