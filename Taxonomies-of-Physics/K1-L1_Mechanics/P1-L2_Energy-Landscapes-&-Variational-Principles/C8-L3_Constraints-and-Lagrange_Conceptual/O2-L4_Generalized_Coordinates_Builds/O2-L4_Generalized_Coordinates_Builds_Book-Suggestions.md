# O2 Generalized Coordinates Builds — Book Suggestions

Choosing generalized coordinates tailors the configuration space to constraints and symmetries. These books teach how to design coordinate sets that simplify equations of motion and reveal conserved quantities.

## Conceptual Primers
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Introduces generalized coordinates with practical guidelines for choosing angles, distances, and minimal sets.
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Louis N. Hand & Janet D. Finch. Provides numerous examples where clever coordinate choices decouple motion.
- *Mechanics (Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 1)* — L.D. Landau & E.M. Lifshitz. Emphasizes symmetry-based coordinate selection in advanced problems.

## Geometry & Transformation Tools
- *Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics* — V.I. Arnold. Uses differential geometry to motivate coordinates on manifolds and Lie groups.
- *Differential Geometry and Lie Groups for Physicists* — Marián Fecko. Helps students build coordinates aligned with group actions and constraints.
- *Classical Dynamics* — Jorge V. José & Eugene J. Saletan. Develops canonical transformations and normal forms that rely on smart coordinate design.

## Engineering & Computational Cases
- *Multibody System Dynamics, Robotics and Control* — Hubert Gattringer & Johann Gerstmayr. Applies generalized coordinates to robot arms, vehicles, and flexible bodies.
- *Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics* — Andrew Pytel & Jaan Kiusalaas. Offers worked problems transitioning from Cartesian to polar, cylindrical, and other specialized coordinates.
- *Simulation of Multibody Systems* — Werner Schiehlen & Michel Valášek. Discusses coordinate partitioning, minimal coordinates, and constraint stabilization in simulations.
