# O2 Energy-Landscape Optimization Routes — Book Suggestions

Gradient-descent style flows reshape energy landscapes toward minima, and engineers need playbooks for choosing steps, preconditioners, and stopping criteria. These books connect physics-informed optimization with practical algorithms across scales.

## Gradient Flow Foundations
- *Convex Optimization* — Stephen Boyd & Lieven Vandenberghe. Establishes descent directions, line search rules, and convergence certificates that mirror physical relaxation in convex landscapes.
- *Nonlinear Programming* — Dimitri P. Bertsekas. Provides detailed treatments of constrained descent, penalty methods, and Lagrangian multipliers for navigating complex energy surfaces.
- *Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics* — V.I. Arnold. Links gradient flows to Hamiltonian structures and Morse theory, giving geometric intuition for descent paths.

## Accelerated & Preconditioned Routes
- *Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds* — P.-A. Absil, R. Mahony, & R. Sepulchre. Covers geodesic search, retraction, and preconditioning on curved energy landscapes.
- *Numerical Optimization* — Jorge Nocedal & Stephen Wright. Details quasi-Newton updates, conjugate-gradient directions, and trust-region methods that speed relaxation without overshooting.
- *Variational Methods with Applications* — Michael Struwe. Shows how gradient flows in function spaces converge via energy estimates, anchoring PDE-based optimization routes.

## Applications & Case Studies
- *Physics-Informed Machine Learning* — Max Welling & Taco Cohen (eds.). Illustrates how energy-based models employ gradient routes for inference and learning.
- *Computational Materials Science* — June Gunn Lee. Demonstrates energy minimization workflows for crystal structures, defects, and molecular dynamics potentials.
- *Topology Optimization in Structural Mechanics* — George I. N. Rozvany. Applies descent-based updates to stiffness and compliance objectives, emphasizing filtering and continuation strategies.
