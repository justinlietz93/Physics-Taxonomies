# C6 Dissipation & Gradient Descent — Book Suggestions

This class links energy loss to relaxation paths down potential slopes. These resources bridge physical damping, optimization heuristics, and landscape smoothing.

## Physical Intuition
- *Classical Mechanics: Systems of Particles and Hamiltonian Dynamics* — José & Saletan. Explains damping forces, Lyapunov functions, and gradient flows for dissipative systems.
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu Rao. Details viscous damping, modal decay, and energy dissipation metrics relevant to descent-like relaxation.

## Mathematical Formulations
- *Gradient Flows in Metric Spaces and in the Space of Probability Measures* — Ambrosio, Gigli & Savaré. Formalizes gradient descent as a flow on energy functionals, highlighting convergence criteria.
- *Nonlinear Programming* — Dimitri Bertsekas. Provides steepest-descent, line-search, and convergence analysis tools that parallel physical gradient descent strategies.

## Computational & Applied Views
- *Numerical Optimization* — Jorge Nocedal & Stephen Wright. Discusses step-size control, preconditioning, and damping analogues that keep descent stable.
- *Physics-Informed Machine Learning* — M. Raissi et al. Surveys how dissipative dynamics inspire optimization schemes for training and inverse problems.
