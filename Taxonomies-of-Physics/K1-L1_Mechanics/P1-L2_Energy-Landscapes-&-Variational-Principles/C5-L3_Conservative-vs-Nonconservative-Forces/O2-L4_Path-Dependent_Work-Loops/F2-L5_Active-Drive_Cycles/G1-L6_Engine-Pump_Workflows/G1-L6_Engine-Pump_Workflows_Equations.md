# G1 Engine-Pump Workflows — Core Equations

Plant teams compare engine and pump duty cycles with a few repeatable energy balances. These relationships tie logged pressure,
 flow, and fuel data to delivered hydraulic work.

## Cycle Work from Indicator Diagrams
**Closed-loop $p$–$V$ work:**

$$
W_{\text{cycle}} = \oint p \, dV
$$

- Integrating pressure $p$ over displacement volume $V$ across an engine cycle converts indicator diagrams into work per revoluti
on for benchmarking against dynamometer readings.

## Pump Hydraulic Power
**Output delivered to the fluid:**

$$
P_{\text{hyd}} = \rho g Q H
$$

- Fluid density $\rho$, volumetric flow $Q$, and developed head $H$ estimate the pump's useful power; technicians compare this to
 shaft input to gauge health.

## Overall Efficiency Tracking
**Fuel-to-fluid conversion:**

$$
\eta_{\text{overall}} = \frac{P_{\text{hyd}}}{\dot{m}_{\text{fuel}} \cdot \text{LHV}}
$$

- Fuel mass flow $\dot{m}_{\text{fuel}}$ multiplied by lower heating value (LHV) provides the chemical power input, enabling eff
iciency trending for combined engine-pump skids.
