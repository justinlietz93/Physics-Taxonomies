# S1-L7_City_Bus_Stop-Go_Fuel_Log — Species Index
**Definition:** Transit agencies track fuel use across stop-and-go routes to see how driver choices alter work input.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Compare gentle acceleration schedules with aggressive ones to show added work done by the engine.
- Emphasize that traffic pattern changes shift energy needs even though start and end depots match.
- Tie results to eco-driving training that trims fuel costs and emissions.
