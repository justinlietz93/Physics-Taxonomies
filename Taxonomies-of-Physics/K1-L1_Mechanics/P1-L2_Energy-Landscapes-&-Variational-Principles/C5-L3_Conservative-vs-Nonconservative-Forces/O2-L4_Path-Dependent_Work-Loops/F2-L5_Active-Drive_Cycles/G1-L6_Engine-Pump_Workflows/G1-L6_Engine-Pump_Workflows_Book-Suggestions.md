stem tuning.

## Pump Performance and Matching
- *Centrifugal and Rotary Pumps* — L. Karassik et al. Offers sizing nomograms and troubleshooting flow-head deviations during ski
d tests.
- *Pump Handbook* — I. J. Karassik et al. Field chapters on aligning pump curves with engine torque envelopes and efficiency trac
king.

## Integrated System Case Studies
- *Industrial Energy Management Principles* — C. A. P. de Azevedo. Demonstrates combining fuel, hydraulic, and maintenance data t
o benchmark system efficiency.
