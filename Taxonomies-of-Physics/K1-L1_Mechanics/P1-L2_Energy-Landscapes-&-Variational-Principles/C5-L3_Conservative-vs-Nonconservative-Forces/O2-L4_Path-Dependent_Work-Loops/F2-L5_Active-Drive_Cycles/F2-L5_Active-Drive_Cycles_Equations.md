# F2 Active Drive Cycles — Core Equations

Active forcing injects energy each cycle, producing loops whose area equals the net work delivered. These relations capture cycle-averaged power and describe Lissajous work plots.

## Cycle Work from Control Force
**Work integral over one period:**

$$W_{\text{cycle}} = \oint_{T} F_{\text{drive}}(t) \; \dot{x}(t) \, dt$$

- Integrating drive force times velocity over one period quantifies net energy input per cycle.

## Equivalent Loop Area
**Force–displacement representation:**

$$W_{\text{cycle}} = \oint F_{\text{drive}} \, dx$$

- Graphically, the signed area enclosed by the force–displacement loop equals the cycle work, aiding experimental visualization.

## Average Power Delivery
**Power from periodic forcing:**

$$P_{\text{avg}} = \frac{W_{\text{cycle}}}{T}$$

- Dividing cycle work by the period $T$ yields the mean power added by the active drive, balancing dissipation in steady operation.
