# S2-L7_Roller_Coaster_Brake_Heat_Check — Species Index
**Definition:** Theme-park crews inspect brake fins and heat sinks to balance regenerated energy with safe slowdowns.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Measure coil temperatures and recovered power after each run to see how much energy braking returns.
- Explain that wetter tracks or heavier trains shift the balance between regenerated and wasted energy.
- Tie monitoring to maintenance schedules that keep riders safe while reclaiming electricity.
