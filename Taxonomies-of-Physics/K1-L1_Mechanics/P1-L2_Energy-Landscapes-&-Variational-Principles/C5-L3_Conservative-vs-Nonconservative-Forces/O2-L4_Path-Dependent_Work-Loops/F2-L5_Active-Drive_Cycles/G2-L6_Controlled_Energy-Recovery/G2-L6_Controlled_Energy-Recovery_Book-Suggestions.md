# G2 Controlled Energy-Recovery — Book Suggestions

Use these texts to design, validate, and troubleshoot regenerative braking and accumulator-based recovery programs.

## Regenerative Drive Foundations
- *Electric and Hybrid Vehicles* — A. Emadi. Explains motor-generator control, recovery efficiency, and battery interaction durin
g deceleration events.
- *Hybrid Powertrains for Commercial Vehicles* — L. Guzzella & A. Sciarretta. Real fleet examples of braking energy capture and p
ower-split calibration.

## Storage System Engineering
- *Battery Management Systems* — G. Plett. Guidance on charge acceptance limits, thermal derating, and logging strategies during 
regen events.
- *Hydraulic Energy Recovery* — R. Rahmfeld & K. Ivantysynova. Design curves for hydro-pneumatic accumulators and pump-motor unit
s targeting industrial cycles.

## Integration and Safety
- *Vehicle Dynamics and Control* — R. Rajamani. Links regenerative torque commands to stability constraints and driver feel.
- *Energy Harvesting Systems* — N. Elvin & A. Erturk. Broader survey of mechanical-to-electrical capture architectures with risk 
mitigation checklists.
