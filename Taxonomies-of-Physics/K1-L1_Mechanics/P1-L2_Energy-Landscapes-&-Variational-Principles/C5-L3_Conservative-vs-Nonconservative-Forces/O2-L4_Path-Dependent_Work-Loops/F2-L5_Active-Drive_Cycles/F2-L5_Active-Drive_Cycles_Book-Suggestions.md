# F2 Active Drive Cycles — Book Suggestions

These titles explore forced vibration, energy harvesting loops, and control strategies that intentionally add or remove energy each cycle.

## Forced Vibration and Energy Methods
- *Nonlinear Oscillations* — Ali H. Nayfeh & Dean T. Mook. Examines energy balance for forced, nonlinear oscillators.
- *Dynamics of Mechanical Systems* — Harold Josephs & Ronald Huston. Discusses work loops and power flow in actuated mechanisms.

## Control and Mechatronics
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene F. Franklin et al. Provides insight into power flow and loop shaping for actuated systems.
- *Smart Materials and Structures* — M. V. Gandhi & B. S. Thompson. Highlights active materials that inject energy for shape change and vibration control.

## Energy Harvesting and Conversion
- *Energy Harvesting Technologies* — Shashank Priya & Daniel Inman (eds.). Contains work-loop analyses for piezoelectric and electromagnetic harvesters.
- *Electroactive Polymer (EAP) Actuators as Artificial Muscles* — Yoseph Bar-Cohen. Features cyclic drive profiles and energy density discussions for dielectric elastomers.
