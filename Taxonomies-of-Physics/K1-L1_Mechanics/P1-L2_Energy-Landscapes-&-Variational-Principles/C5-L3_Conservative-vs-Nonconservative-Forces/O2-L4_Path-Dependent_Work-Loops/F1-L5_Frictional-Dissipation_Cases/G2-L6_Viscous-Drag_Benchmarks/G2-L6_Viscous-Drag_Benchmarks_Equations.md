# G2 Viscous-Drag Benchmarks â€” Core Equations

Fluid-handling labs anchor their drag characterisation to a handful of low-Reynolds-number relationships that translate straight
 into energy budgets for guides and bearing sleeves.

## Stokes Drag on Test Pins
**Baseline force in laminar flow:**

$$
F_d = 6 \pi \mu R v
$$

- For calibration spheres or cylindrical pins of radius $R$ moving at speed $v$ in a fluid of viscosity $\mu$, this relation set
s the reference drag to compare against measured tare loads.

## Reynolds Number Screening
**Laminar validity check:**

$$
\mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
$$

- Using fluid density $\rho$, characteristic diameter $D$, and test velocity $v$, technicians confirm that $\mathrm{Re} < 1$ so 
Stokes drag assumptions remain valid during benchmark runs.

## Drag Power Dissipation
**Energy rate in steady sliding:**

$$
P_{\text{drag}} = F_d \, v
$$

- Multiplying measured drag force by traverse speed converts rig readings into watts, making it easy to compare sleeve losses to 
motor nameplate allowances.
