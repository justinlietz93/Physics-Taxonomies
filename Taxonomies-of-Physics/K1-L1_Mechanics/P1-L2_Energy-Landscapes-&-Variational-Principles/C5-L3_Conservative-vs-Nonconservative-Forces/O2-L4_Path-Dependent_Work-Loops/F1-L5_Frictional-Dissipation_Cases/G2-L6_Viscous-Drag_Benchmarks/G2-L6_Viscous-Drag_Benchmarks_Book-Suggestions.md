# G2 Viscous-Drag Benchmarks — Book Suggestions

These titles support technicians who calibrate viscous drag rigs and convert low-speed measurements into dependable power-loss e
stimates.

## Fundamentals and Theory
- *Viscous Fluid Flow* — F. M. White. Clear derivations of laminar drag laws with worked examples tailored to journal bearings an
d guideways.
- *Low Reynolds Number Hydrodynamics* — J. Happel & H. Brenner. Deep reference on creeping-flow corrections for non-spherical be
nchmark pieces.

## Measurement Techniques
- *Experimental Fluid Mechanics* — P. Bradshaw. Instrument setup guidance for torque arms, laser velocimetry, and force balances 
used in drag calibration.
- *Flow Measurement Handbook* — R. W. Miller. Field-proven methods to confirm viscosity, density, and uncertainty before testing.

## Application Casebooks
- *Bearing Design in Machinery* — T. A. Harris & M. N. Kotzalas. Shows how drag curves inform lubrication and cooling design in 
rotating equipment.
- *Hydrodynamic Lubrication* — H. Pinkus & B. Sternlicht. Connects low-Re benchmarks to film-thickness predictions for sleeves a
nd pads.
