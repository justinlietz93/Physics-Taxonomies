# S1-L7_Factory_Conveyor_Belt_Wear — Species Index
**Definition:** Maintenance crews log energy draw around conveyor loops to track friction losses as rollers age.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Compare motor power on empty vs. loaded belts to reveal extra work spent on friction hot spots.
- Note that reversing the belt takes different energy because worn bearings waste work each lap.
- Link the audit to scheduling lubrication and roller swaps before breakdowns stall production.
