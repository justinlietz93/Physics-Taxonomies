# G1 Sliding-Contact Studies — Book Suggestions

These resources help maintenance crews translate lab friction measurements into actionable sliding contact diagnostics in plant
 and transport settings.

## Field Tribology Primers
- *Engineering Tribology* — G. Stachowiak & A. Batchelor. Provides kinetic friction measurement setups, uncertainty budgets, and
 case studies for conveyor and brake materials.
- *Tribology Data Handbook* — E. Rabinowicz. Quick-look coefficients and wear constants for common pad–disk and belt–roller pairi
ngs.

## Diagnostics and Instrumentation
- *Friction and Wear of Materials* — E. Rabinowicz. Details pin-on-disk correlation charts that translate rig data to production 
lines.
- *Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-Stationary Operations* — A. Sapietová et al. Covers torque, temperature, and vibrati
on sensing suites tailored for sliding contact audits.

## Applied Case Files
- *Practical Guide to Industrial Lubrication* — L. M. Rudnick. Connects friction energy estimates to lubricant selection and regr
ease schedules.
- *Brake Design and Safety* — R. Limpert. Grounded examples of dynamometer testing and in-vehicle validation for pads and rotors 
under repeated sliding duty.
