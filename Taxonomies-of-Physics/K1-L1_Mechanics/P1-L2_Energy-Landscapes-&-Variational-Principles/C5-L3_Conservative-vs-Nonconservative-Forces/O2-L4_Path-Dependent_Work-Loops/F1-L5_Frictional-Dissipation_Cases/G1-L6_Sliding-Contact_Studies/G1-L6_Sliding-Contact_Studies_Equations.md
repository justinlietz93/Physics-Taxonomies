# G1 Sliding-Contact Studies â€” Core Equations

Tribology teams track simple friction balances to estimate heat, wear, and power losses during sliding inspections. These relati
onships tie directly to pad dynamometer tests and conveyor belt audits.

## Kinetic Friction Load
**Measured tangential resistance:**

$$
F_{\text{fric}} = \mu_k N
$$

- With surface-normal load $N$ and measured kinetic coefficient $\mu_k$, crews predict drawbar pull or brake torque required to m
aintain constant slip.

## Dissipated Work Over a Pass
**Energy lost along one traverse:**

$$
W_{\text{pass}} = F_{\text{fric}} \, s = \mu_k N s
$$

- Multiplying the friction load by traveled distance $s$ estimates belt heating per lap and helps flag overload when $W_{\text{p
ass}}$ exceeds cooling capacity.

## Archard Wear Volume Rate
**Contact wear forecasting:**

$$
\dot{V} = k \frac{N v}{H}
$$

- Archard's wear constant $k$, sliding speed $v$, and surface hardness $H$ combine with the applied load $N$ to project material 
loss per unit time, guiding lube intervals and pad replacement plans.
