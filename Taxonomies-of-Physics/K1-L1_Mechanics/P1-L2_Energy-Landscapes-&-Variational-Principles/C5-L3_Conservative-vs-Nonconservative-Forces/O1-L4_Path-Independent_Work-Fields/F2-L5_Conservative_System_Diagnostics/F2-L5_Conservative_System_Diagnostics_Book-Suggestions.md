# F2 Conservative System Diagnostics — Book Suggestions

These references emphasize mathematical diagnostics, experimental verification, and computational tools for assessing conservative forces.

## Mathematical Foundations
- *Advanced Engineering Mathematics* — Erwin Kreyszig. Covers curl tests, potential functions, and exact differential forms.
- *Mathematical Methods for Physicists* — Arfken, Weber & Harris. Provides vector calculus identities used in conservative diagnostics.

## Measurement and System Identification
- *Experimental Methods for Engineers* — J. P. Holman. Discusses uncertainty analysis for loop integrals and force measurements.
- *System Identification: Theory for the User* — Lennart Ljung. Shows how to detect non-conservative damping terms from data.

## Simulation and Energy Methods
- *Computational Mechanics of Discontinua* — Antonio Munjiza. Uses numerical experiments to test energy balance and detect non-conservative forces.
- *Nonlinear Finite Elements for Continua and Structures* — Ted Belytschko et al. Highlights energy-momentum conserving algorithms to benchmark diagnostics.
