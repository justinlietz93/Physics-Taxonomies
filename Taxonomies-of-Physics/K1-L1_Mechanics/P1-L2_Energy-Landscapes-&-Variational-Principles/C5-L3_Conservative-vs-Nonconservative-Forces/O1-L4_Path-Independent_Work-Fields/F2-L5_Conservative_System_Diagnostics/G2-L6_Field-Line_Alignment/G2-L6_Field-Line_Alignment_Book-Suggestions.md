# G2 Field-Line Alignment — Book Suggestions

These titles help practitioners reconcile measured field directions with potential gradients, ensuring reported lines remain faithful to conservative physics.

## Alignment Techniques
- *Vector Field Analysis* — J. A. Schey. Explains gradient, divergence, and curl diagnostics with worked mechanical examples ideal for alignment teams.
- *Electrostatic Laboratory Techniques* — R. Fitzpatrick. Focuses on mapping equipotential lines and evaluating angular deviations between measured fields and potential gradients.

## Instrumentation and Mapping
- *Field Mapping with Portable Sensors* — K. T. Chau. Provides guidance on magnetometers, force probes, and spatial interpolation routines used when drawing field lines.
- *Geophysical Field Techniques* — C. Clarkson. Emphasizes curl checks, loop traverses, and data conditioning for gravitational and magnetic surveys.

## Quality Assurance Resources
- *Engineering Measurement: Theory and Practice* — R. C. Baker. Details alignment tolerances, cosine error mitigation, and calibration routines for directional sensors.
- *Practical Uncertainty Analysis for Field Measurements* — H. Ku. Offers methods to quantify and report angular misalignment and equipotential drift with confidence bounds.
