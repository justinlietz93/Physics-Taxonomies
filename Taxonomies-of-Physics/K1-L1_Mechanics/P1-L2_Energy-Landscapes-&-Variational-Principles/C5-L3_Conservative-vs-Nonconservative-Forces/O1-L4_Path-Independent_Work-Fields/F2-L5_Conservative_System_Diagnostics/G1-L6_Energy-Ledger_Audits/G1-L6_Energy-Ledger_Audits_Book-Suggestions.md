# G1 Energy-Ledger Audits — Book Suggestions

Energy auditors benefit from resources that pair conservation theory with logging, instrumentation, and reporting patterns suited to mechanical plants and lab rigs.

## Conservation Fundamentals
- *Classical Mechanics* — J. R. Taylor. Clear chapters on work-energy theorems and conservative systems that underpin ledger equations.
- *Analytical Mechanics for Engineers* — F. R. Gantmacher. Bridges potential landscapes with measurement strategies for verifying $E_{\text{mech}}$ balances.

## Instrumentation and Data Logging
- *Experimental Methods for Engineers* — J. P. Holman. Guidance on synchronized velocity, force, and position measurements plus uncertainty propagation for energy budgets.
- *Data Acquisition Systems* — M. P. Groover. Practical coverage of sensor fusion and timestamp alignment critical to accurate mechanical energy ledgers.

## Audit and Reporting Playbooks
- *Energy Auditing Techniques for Industry* — A. Thumann. Templates for documenting conservative assumptions, residual metrics, and follow-up actions.
- *Measurement and Data Analysis for Engineering and Science* — P. Allen. Worked examples on comparing measured work against theoretical expectations with defensible error bars.
