# G1 Potential-Surface Surveys — Book Suggestions

These picks help small teams turn contour measurements into defensible potential maps, blending field methods with classroom-grade explanations of conservative forces.

## Survey Method Primers
- *Applied Geodesy and Field Mapping* — E. Grafarend. Covers leveling loops, total station workflows, and quick numerical checks for zero work around closed traverses.
- *Electrostatic Field Mapping Experiments* — A. J. D. Farmer. Step-by-step procedures for conductive paper labs and interpolation strategies to refine $\Phi(\mathbf{r})$ grids.

## Data Reduction Guides
- *Numerical Methods for Engineers* — S. C. Chapra. Practical gradient and line-integration routines that match spreadsheet or Python notebooks used during potential surveys.
- *Practical Error Analysis* — J. R. Taylor. Explains uncertainty budgeting so crews can distinguish sensor noise from genuine non-conservative anomalies.

## Context and Case Studies
- *Gravity and Magnetic Exploration* — W. M. Telford. Real-world chapters on mapping gravitational potential differences across terrain with emphasis on QA/QC loops.
- *Electrostatics in the Laboratory* — M. N. O. Sadiku. Demonstrates classroom-to-field transitions with conservative field diagnostics and reporting templates.
