# G1 Potential-Surface Surveys â€” Core Equations

Field labs that chart gravitational or electrostatic surfaces rely on compact work-energy relationships. These expressions keep crews honest as they map contours and verify conservative behaviour.

## Potential Gradient to Force
**From mapped potential $\Phi(\mathbf{r})$ to field measurements:**

$$
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = -\nabla \Phi(\mathbf{r})
$$

- Survey crews differentiate the recorded potential grid to predict local forces; alignment with probe readings flags that the surface truly reflects a conservative field.

## Loop Work Consistency
**Closed-path integral check:**

$$
W_{\text{loop}} = \oint_{\mathcal{C}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0
$$

- Numerically evaluating the loop integral along stitched survey legs should collapse toward zero; deviations highlight data gaps or sensor bias that need a re-run.

## Elevation-Based Potential Differences
**Gravity mapping over modest terrain:**

$$
\Delta \Phi = g \, \Delta h
$$

- For near-Earth surveys with small elevation changes, the product of gravitational acceleration $g$ and height shift $\Delta h$ offers a quick cross-check between altimeter readings and measured potential differences.
