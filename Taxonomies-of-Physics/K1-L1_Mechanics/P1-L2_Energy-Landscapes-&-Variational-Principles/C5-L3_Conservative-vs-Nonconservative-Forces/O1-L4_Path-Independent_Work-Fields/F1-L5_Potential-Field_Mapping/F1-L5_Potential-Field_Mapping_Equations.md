# F1 Potential Field Mapping — Core Equations

Conservative force fields derive from scalar potentials, allowing path-independent work evaluation. These relations summarize potential gradients, path integrals, and Laplace constraints.

## Force from Potential
**Gradient relation:**

$$\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = - \nabla U(\mathbf{r})$$

- Conservative forces follow from the spatial gradient of potential energy $U$, enabling direct mapping between measured forces and potential surfaces.

## Path-Independent Work
**Closed-loop integral:**

$$\oint_{C} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0$$

- For any closed contour $C$, net work vanishes; this property validates potential-field assumptions via experimental loop integrals.

## Laplace Equation in Charge-Free Regions
**Potential smoothness:**

$$\nabla^{2} U = 0$$

- In regions without sources, potential satisfies Laplace’s equation, guiding interpolation between sparse field measurements.
