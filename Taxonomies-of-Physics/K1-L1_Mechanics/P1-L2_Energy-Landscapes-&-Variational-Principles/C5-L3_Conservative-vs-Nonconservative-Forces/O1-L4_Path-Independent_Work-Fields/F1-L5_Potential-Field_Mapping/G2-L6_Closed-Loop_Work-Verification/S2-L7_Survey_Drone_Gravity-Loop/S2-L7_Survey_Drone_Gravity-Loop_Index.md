# S2-L7_Survey_Drone_Gravity-Loop — Species Index
**Definition:** Mapping crews fly rectangular loops and compare climb vs. descent energy to validate gravity models.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Outline how drone autopilots log battery use on closed loops to ensure no energy gain or loss sneaks in.
- Use the check to illustrate that gravitational potential depends only on endpoints, even over rugged terrain.
- Note that big mismatches flag sensor calibration issues rather than exotic physics.
