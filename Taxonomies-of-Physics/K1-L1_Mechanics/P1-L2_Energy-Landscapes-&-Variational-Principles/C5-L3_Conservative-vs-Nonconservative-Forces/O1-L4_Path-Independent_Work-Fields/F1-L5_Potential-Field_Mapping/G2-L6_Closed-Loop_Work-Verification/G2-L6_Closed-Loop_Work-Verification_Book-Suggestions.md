# G2 Closed-Loop Work Verification — Book Suggestions

These resources help auditing teams translate loop traverses into defensible work-balance statements, with emphasis on uncertainty budgets and repeatable diagnostics.

## Field Audit Handbooks
- *Engineering Surveying* — W. Schofield & M. Breach. Provides loop closure procedures, misclosure tolerances, and documentation templates for re-running suspect legs.
- *Practical Electrical Measurements* — I. N. Levine. Outlines conservative-field tests for electrostatic labs, including closed path checks and instrumentation corrections.

## Data Analytics References
- *Statistical Methods for Engineers* — G. G. Vining. Introduces z-score and residual analysis tools suited for flagging segments that breach conservative expectations.
- *Measurement Uncertainty* — L. Kirkup & R. Frenkel. Guides the creation of loop work budgets and how to report residuals alongside confidence intervals.

## Case Reports and Best Practices
- *Quality Assurance in Geophysical Surveys* — R. D. Regan. Shares case histories where loop work audits identified calibration drifts and how teams resolved them.
- *Operational Modal Analysis and Validation* — P. Brincker & C. Ventura. While vibration-focused, its chapters on closure tests and iterative re-surveys translate cleanly to mechanical work verification loops.
