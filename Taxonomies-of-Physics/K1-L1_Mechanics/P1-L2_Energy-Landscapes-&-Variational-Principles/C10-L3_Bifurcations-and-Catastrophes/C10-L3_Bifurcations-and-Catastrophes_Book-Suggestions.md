# C10 Bifurcations & Catastrophes — Book Suggestions

Bifurcations track how a landscape reshapes when control parameters change, spawning or annihilating equilibria. These texts balance qualitative pictures with the algebra needed to classify catastrophes.

## Conceptual Overviews
- *Catastrophe Theory and Its Applications* — Tim Poston & Ian Stewart. Offers an accessible catalogue of fold, cusp, and swallowtail catastrophes with physical examples.
- *Applied Nonlinear Dynamics* — Ali Nayfeh & Balakumar Balachandran. Explains how equilibria split or merge under parameter sweeps in mechanical systems.

## Mathematical Frameworks
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven Strogatz. Introduces fixed-point diagrams, normal forms, and bifurcation taxonomy with intuitive sketches.
- *Singularity Theory: An Introduction with Catastrophe Theory* — Peter G. Gibson. Provides the algebraic classification tools used to label higher-order catastrophes.

## Applications
- *Pattern Formation and Dynamics in Nonequilibrium Systems* — Michael Cross & Henry Greenside. Shows how bifurcations seed patterns, linking the class to later orders and families.
- *Mechanical and Structural Vibrations* — Jerry Ginsberg. Covers snap-through, flutter, and other structural instabilities that map directly onto catastrophe diagrams.
