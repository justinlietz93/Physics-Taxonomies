# G1 One-Dimensional Center Manifold Cases Core Scenarios â€” Core Equations

Near bifurcations, high-dimensional dynamics collapse onto a center manifold. Analysts extract the reduced equation to predict qualitative change.

## Center Manifold Expansion
**Expresses stable variables in terms of the critical coordinate.**

$$y = h(x) = a x^{2} + b x^{3} + \\cdots$$

- Coefficients $a,b$ solve invariance equations ensuring trajectories stay on the manifold.
## Reduced Dynamics
**Gives flow along the center direction.**

$$\\dot{x} = \\mu x + c x^{3} + \\cdots$$

- Parameter $\mu$ tunes stability; the cubic term $c$ shapes pitchfork versus transcritical transitions.
## Stability Criterion
**Classifies fixed point stability on the manifold.**

$$\\frac{d}{dx}(\\mu x + c x^{3}) = \\mu + 3 c x^{2}$$

- Sign of the derivative at equilibrium determines attraction or repulsion in the reduced system.
