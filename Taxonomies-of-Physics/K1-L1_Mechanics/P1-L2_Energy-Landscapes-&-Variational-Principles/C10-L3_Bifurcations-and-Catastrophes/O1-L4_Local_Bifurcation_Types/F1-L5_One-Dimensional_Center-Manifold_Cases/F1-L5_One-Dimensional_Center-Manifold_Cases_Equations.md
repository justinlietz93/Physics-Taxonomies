# F1 One-Dimensional Center-Manifold Cases â€” Core Equations

Near equilibrium, many systems reduce to one-dimensional center manifolds capturing bifurcation behavior. These equations summarize normal forms for pitchfork and saddle-node cases.

## Saddle-Node Normal Form
**Reduced dynamics:**

$$\dot{x} = \mu \pm x^{2}$$

- Control parameter $\mu$ tunes coalescence of equilibria; sign distinguishes creation vs annihilation branches.

## Pitchfork Normal Form
**Symmetric bifurcation:**

$$\dot{x} = \mu x - x^{3}$$

- Exhibits symmetry-induced branches; for $\mu>0$ two stable equilibria emerge at $x = \pm \sqrt{\mu}$.

## Center-Manifold Approximation
**Reduction recipe:**

$$\dot{x} = f(x, \mu), \qquad y = h(x, \mu)$$

- Fast variables $y$ expressed as $h(x, \mu)$ define the center manifold; substituting into full system yields one-dimensional normal form governing slow dynamics.
