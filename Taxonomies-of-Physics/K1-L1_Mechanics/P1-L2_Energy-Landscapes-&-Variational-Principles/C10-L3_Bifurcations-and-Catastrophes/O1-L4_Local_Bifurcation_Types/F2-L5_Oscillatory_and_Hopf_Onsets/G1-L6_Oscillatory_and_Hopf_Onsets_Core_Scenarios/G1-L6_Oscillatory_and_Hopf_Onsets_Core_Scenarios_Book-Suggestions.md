# G1 Oscillatory and Hopf Onsets Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

At a Hopf bifurcation, a fixed point loses stability and a limit cycle appears. Core diagnostics track eigenvalues crossing the imaginary axis.

## Hopf Theory
* *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Strogatz. Introduces Hopf conditions and amplitude scaling.
* *Applied Nonlinear Dynamics* — Nayfeh & Balachandran. Provides formulas for Lyapunov coefficients.
## Oscillator Case Studies
* *Synchronization: A Universal Concept* — Pikovsky, Rosenblum, & Kurths. Demonstrates Hopf onsets in physical systems.
* *Mathematical Biology* — Murray. Applies Hopf bifurcation to population cycles.
