# G1 Cusp and Fold Mappings Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Catastrophe maps project control parameters into response surfaces, revealing folds and cusps where equilibria merge.

## Catastrophe Theory Primers
* *Catastrophe Theory* — Tim Poston & Ian Stewart. Introduces cusp and fold mappings with geometric insight.
* *Singularities and Groups in Bifurcation Theory* — Golubitsky & Schaeffer. Provides canonical forms and unfoldings.
## Applied Response Surfaces
* *Energy Landscapes* — Wales. Shows cusp structures in cluster rearrangements.
* *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Thompson & Stewart. Applies catastrophe maps to buckling and snap-through.
