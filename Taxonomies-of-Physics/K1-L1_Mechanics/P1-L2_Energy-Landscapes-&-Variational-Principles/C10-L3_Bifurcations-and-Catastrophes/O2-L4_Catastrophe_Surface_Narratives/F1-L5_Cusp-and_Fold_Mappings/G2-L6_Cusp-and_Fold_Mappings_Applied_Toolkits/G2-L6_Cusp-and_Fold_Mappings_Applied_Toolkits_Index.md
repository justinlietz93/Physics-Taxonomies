# G2-L6_Cusp-and_Fold_Mappings_Applied_Toolkits — Genus Index
**Definition:** Applied toolkits that translate cusp and fold maps into inspection and control moves.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Aircraft_Flap_Cusp_Audit_Kit** — flight test audit kit that watches lift curves for cusp-style stick shaker jumps.
- **S2-L7_Power_System_Fold_Contour_Log** — grid planning log that traces fold lines while scheduling load tap changers.
