# G1 Higher-Codimension Shapes Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Higher-codimension catastrophes involve multiple control parameters; analysts classify swallowtails and butterflies by unfolding polynomials.

## Advanced Catastrophe Theory
* *Singularities and Groups in Bifurcation Theory* — Golubitsky & Schaeffer. Details swallowtails and higher-order forms.
* *Catastrophe Theory for Scientists and Engineers* — Gilmore. Provides intuitive pictures of higher-codimension surfaces.
## Applications
* *Catastrophe Theory and Its Applications* — Tim Poston. Applies higher-codimension models to optics and mechanics.
* *Energy Landscapes* — Wales. Discusses multi-parameter unfolding in cluster dynamics.
