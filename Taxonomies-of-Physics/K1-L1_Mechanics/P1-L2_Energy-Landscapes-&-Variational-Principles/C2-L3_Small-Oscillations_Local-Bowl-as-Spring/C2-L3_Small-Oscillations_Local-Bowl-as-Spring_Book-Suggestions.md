# C2 Small Oscillations: Local Bowl as Spring — Book Suggestions

This class unpacks how gentle displacements near a minimum behave like coupled springs. The books below mix analytic mode-finding, experimental intuition, and computational diagonalization tuned to the small-oscillation regime.

## Linearized Mechanics Guides
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Chapters on small oscillations and normal modes lay out the coordinate choices and matrix tricks central to this class.
- *Mechanics* — L.D. Landau & E.M. Lifshitz. Provides concise derivations of normal-mode theory and stability tests for multi-degree systems.

## Coupled Oscillator Applications
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Bridges theory to engineering examples, from beams to rotating shafts, reinforcing mode shapes and damping interpretations.
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Uses lattice vibrations and phonons to illustrate how local bowls replicate across periodic media.

## Computational & Experimental Perspectives
- *Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing* — William H. Press et al. Details eigenvalue solvers and time-integration schemes for linearized motion matrices.
- *Physics of Oscillations and Waves* — Ahmed Zewail & John Thomas. Combines laboratory techniques and visualization approaches that keep the small-amplitude assumption tangible.
