# O1 Normal-Mode Decompositions — Book Suggestions

Diagonalizing coupled oscillators shows how shared stiffness and inertia split into clean, independent beats. These titles keep the workflows tangible so students can actually compute the modes and see their physical meaning.

## Linear Foundations
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein, Charles P. Poole Jr., & John L. Safko. Walks through small-oscillation expansions and sets up the mass–stiffness eigenproblem in canonical coordinates.
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Fowles & Cassiday. Provides step-by-step worked examples of linearized multi-degree systems that map directly to classroom lab rigs.

## Matrix & Computational Views
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Bridges stiffness and mass matrices, Rayleigh quotients, and orthogonality relations for engineers tuning real structures.
- *Matrix Analysis of Structures* — Aslam Kassimali. Shows how to implement modal decompositions in finite-element form, keeping the notation compatible with the taxonomy’s energy-landscape language.

## Experiments & Intuition
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Uses coupled pendula and strings to illustrate mode shapes that can be filmed or probed in the lab.
- *Normal Modes and Symmetry* — Michael Tinkham. Connects group-theory symmetry arguments to degeneracy splitting so students can spot when modes align with physical symmetries.
