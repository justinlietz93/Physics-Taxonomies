# G1 Mass-Spring Chains Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Starter normal-mode labs benefit from texts that mix pencil-and-paper derivations with bench-ready measurement checklists. These picks keep the setup simple while explaining what each sensor should reveal.

## Lab-Focused Primers
- *Mechanical Vibrations: Laboratory Manual* — J. Tang. Step-by-step build notes for three-mass rigs, modal testing tips, and troubleshooting guides for tracking orthogonality with accelerometers.
- *Vibration Experiments for Students* — W. Weaver. Compact chapters on fixed-fixed chains, FFT workflows, and comparison charts for theory versus captured data.

## Conceptual Refreshers
- *Essential Mechanics for Laboratory Experiments* — J. M. Gere. Reintroduces mass-spring matrices and energy checks with clear worked examples aligned to short-chain demonstrations.
- *Mechanical Oscillations: An Introductory Survey* — M. Clough. Bridges between single-degree intuition and coupled-chain behaviour with emphasis on interpreting eigenvectors physically.

## Data Acquisition Companions
- *Signals and Noise in Mechanical Measurements* — A. E. Beards. Explains sensor placement, anti-alias filtering, and modal curve fitting tuned to undergraduate rigs.
- *Practical Modal Analysis* — D. Ewins. Offers practitioner checklists for validating mode shapes, estimating damping from ringdown, and documenting uncertainty in lab reports.
