# G2 Mass-Spring Chains Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Extended chains demand references that blend modal theory with instrumentation, data processing, and retrofit insights. These titles help technicians translate classroom eigenvectors into factory-ready acceptance tests.

## Modal Testing Handbooks
- *Experimental Modal Analysis* — M. Richardson & D. Formenti. Covers impact hammer selection, receptance curve fitting, and troubleshooting of lightly damped chains used in qualification labs.
- *Operational Modal Analysis* — P. Brincker & C. Ventura. Shows how to extract mode shapes from ambient data when shakers cannot be installed on production assemblies.

## Structural Dynamics References
- *Structural Dynamics in Industry* — B. Balachandran. Chapters on multi-span conveyor lines and machine tool drives highlight how mass-spring analogues predict resonance hazards.
- *Mechanical Vibrations in Practice* — V. Piccirillo. Provides tuning recipes for adding dampers or stiffness to eliminate problematic peaks spotted during acceptance testing.

## Data & Control Integration
- *Vibration Control Engineering* — N. C. Singer. Explains how FRFs feed into notch filters, active damping, and supervisory alarms for long-chain production equipment.
- *Measurement and Signal Analysis for Mechanical Systems* — J. De Clerck. Gives workflow checklists for sensor calibration, uncertainty reporting, and automated log decrement extraction.
