# F1 Mass-Spring Chains — Book Suggestions

These references emphasize discrete lattice vibrations, normal-mode extraction, and experimental analogues built from coupled oscillators.

## Foundational Texts
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Introduces multi-degree-of-freedom mass–spring systems and modal superposition methods.
- *Theory of Vibration with Applications* — William T. Thomson & Marie Dillon Dahleh. Derives chain equations and mode shapes for engineering structures.

## Lattice and Solid-State Perspectives
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Presents discrete lattice dispersion and phonon concepts analogous to mass–spring chains.
- *Lattice Vibrations* — A. A. Maradudin et al. Explores normal modes and density-of-states calculations for one-dimensional oscillator chains.

## Laboratory and Computational Guides
- *Vibrations and Waves in Physics* — Iain G. Main. Provides tabletop experiments with coupled pendula and springs illustrating discrete modes.
- *Finite Element Procedures* — Klaus-Jürgen Bathe. Shows how mass–spring chains inspire assembled stiffness and mass matrices for structural models.
