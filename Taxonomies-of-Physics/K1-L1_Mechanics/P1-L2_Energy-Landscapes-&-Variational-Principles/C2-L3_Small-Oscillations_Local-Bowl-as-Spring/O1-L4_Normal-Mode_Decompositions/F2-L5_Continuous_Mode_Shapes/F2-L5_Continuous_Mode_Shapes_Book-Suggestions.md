# F2 Continuous Mode Shapes — Book Suggestions

These books focus on continuous vibration theory, providing analytical mode solutions, boundary condition treatments, and numerical tools.

## Analytical Foundations
- *Vibrations of Continuous Systems* — Singiresu S. Rao. Covers strings, rods, and beams with closed-form eigenfunctions.
- *Mechanics of Continuous Media* — Lawrence E. Malvern. Derives field equations and modal expansions for elastic continua.

## Structural Dynamics Guides
- *Theory of Vibrations with Applications* — William T. Thomson & Marie Dillon Dahleh. Includes mode tables for beams, plates, and shells.
- *Structural Dynamics: Theory and Computation* — Mario Paz & William Leigh. Bridges analytical solutions with finite-element discretizations.

## Experimental and Numerical References
- *Modal Testing: Theory, Practice and Application* — D. J. Ewins. Shows how to extract continuous mode shapes from measurement data.
- *The Finite Element Method in Engineering* — S. S. Rao. Demonstrates how discretization approximates continuous modes for complex geometries.
