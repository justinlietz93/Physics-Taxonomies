# G2 Continuous Mode Shapes Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Practitioners matching test data to simulation rely on resources that emphasise correlation metrics, health diagnostics, and automation. These books provide ready-to-use recipes for continuous structures.

## Correlation & Validation Guides
- *Finite Element Model Updating in Structural Dynamics* — M. Friswell & J. Mottershead. Deep coverage of MAC, coordinate expansion, and sensitivity-based tuning for beams and plates.
- *Model Correlation and Validation* — G. Heylen. Offers procedural checklists for comparing measured and analytical mode sets, including weighting strategies for continuous systems.

## Damage Detection & Monitoring
- *Structural Health Monitoring: A Machine Learning Perspective* — C. R. Farrar & K. Worden. Chapters on curvature indicators and modal feature extraction suit long-span beams and aerospace skins.
- *Damage Detection in Structures by Vibration Monitoring* — C. Boller. Provides case studies using modal curvature and participation metrics to localise fatigue hotspots.

## Measurement Automation
- *Laser Doppler Vibrometry* — K. Graff & S. Rothberg. Explains scanning strategies, stitching algorithms, and data formats for dense mode shape maps on plates and shells.
- *Operational Modal Analysis for Civil Engineering Structures* — A. Cunha et al. Supplies scripts and workflows for processing ambient response data when forced tests are impractical.
