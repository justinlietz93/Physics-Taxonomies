# G1 Continuous Mode Shapes Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These picks help learners interpret classical beam and membrane solutions before stepping into more exotic continua. Each text includes drawings or lab photos that make nodal lines intuitive.

## Beam and Plate Classics
- *Theory of Vibrations with Applications* — W. T. Thomson & M. Dillon Dahleh. Clear derivations of clamped beam characteristic equations and practice tables for the first few roots.
- *Fundamentals of Vibrations* — L. Meirovitch. Visualises mode shapes with sketches and provides orthogonality proofs used to process strain-gauge data.

## Hands-On Demonstrations
- *Chladni Figures: A Study in Symmetry* — E. Benary. Photo-rich walkthroughs for sand patterns on plates, matched with the governing membrane equations.
- *Laboratory Experiments in Structural Dynamics* — R. Ewins. Lab sheets for beam sweeps and MEMS membrane scans that emphasise boundary-condition checks.

## Numerical Companions
- *Finite Element Procedures* — K. J. Bathe. Introductory chapters show how continuous mode problems discretise, letting students compare analytical modes with FE approximations.
- *Modal Analysis with MATLAB* — K. G. McConnell. Provides scripts that compute beam and membrane shapes and overlay them with experimental data for quick validation.
