# O2 Forced and Damped Responses — Book Suggestions

Adding damping and drives reveals how linear modes interact with energy loss and periodic inputs. These picks foreground measurable responses so learners can connect the math to shaker-table tests and sensor readouts.

## Damped Oscillator Playbooks
- *Vibration Problems in Engineering* — Stephen Timoshenko & D.H. Young. Classic treatment of viscous and structural damping with worked response curves.
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — S. Graham Kelly. Explains how to tune damping ratios, transmissibility, and resonance suppression in real hardware.

## Forced Response Analysis
- *Mechanical Vibrations: Theory and Applications* — William T. Thomson & Marie Dillon Dahleh. Details steady-state sinusoidal response, base excitation, and frequency response functions.
- *Random Vibrations* — David E. Newland. Extends forced responses to broadband inputs and provides practical spectral-density methods.

## Testing & Control
- *Experimental Modal Analysis* — Ewins. Shows how to identify damping and forcing parameters from measured transfer functions.
- *Active Vibration Control* — Christopher Fuller, Sharon Elliott, & P.A. Nelson. Links forced responses to feedforward/feedback strategies for suppressing peaks.
