# G2 Damping and Control Strategies Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Field teams need resources that push beyond basic absorbers into semi-active and optimal control implementations. These books provide design data, controller derivations, and commissioning case studies.

## Viscoelastic & Passive Design Manuals
- *Viscoelastic Vibration Damping* — D. I. G. Jones. Supplies frequency-dependent modulus charts and design factors for laminated pads and constrained-layer treatments.
- *Handbook of Vibration Control* — A. Preumont (ed.). Aggregates best-practice chapters on tuned dampers, passive isolators, and retrofit design examples.

## Semi-Active and Adaptive Control
- *Magnetorheological Fluid Technology* — M. R. Jolly. Details clipped optimal laws, current-force calibration curves, and deployment tips for MR dampers.
- *Smart Structures: Analysis and Design* — A. Baz. Explains implementation of semi-active controllers, sensing strategies, and real-world aerospace demonstrations.

## Optimal Control & Implementation
- *Vibration Control Using Active Materials* — C. K. Ahn & H. B. Lee. Walks through LQR formulations, observer design, and embedded coding for structural panels.
- *Modern Control of Vibration and Noise* — C. Fuller, S. Elliott & P. Nelson. Combines theory with industrial case studies using state-space solvers and adaptive feedforward systems.
