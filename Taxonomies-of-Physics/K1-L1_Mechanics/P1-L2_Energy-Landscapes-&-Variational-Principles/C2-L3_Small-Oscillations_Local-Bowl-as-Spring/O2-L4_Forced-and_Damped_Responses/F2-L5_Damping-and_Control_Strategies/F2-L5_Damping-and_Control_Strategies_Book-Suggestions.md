# F2 Damping and Control Strategies — Book Suggestions

These resources cover passive damping hardware, active vibration suppression, and system identification techniques for tuning control laws.

## Passive Damping Design
- *Damping in Structural Engineering* — T. K. Datta. Reviews viscous, Coulomb, and viscoelastic damper sizing.
- *Structural Control and Vibration Mitigation* — Fabio Casciati & Michele Giacomo Giordano. Details tuned mass dampers and base isolation case studies.

## Active Control Frameworks
- *Active Control of Vibration* — Christopher Fuller, Sharon Elliott & P. A. Nelson. Presents state-space control, adaptive algorithms, and implementation details.
- *Vibration Control of Active Structures* — Andrzej Preumont. Highlights actuator/sensor placement and feedback gains for damping augmentation.

## Identification and Optimization
- *System Identification: Theory for the User* — Lennart Ljung. Provides tools to estimate damping matrices and model uncertainties.
- *Optimization of Structural and Mechanical Systems* — Jasbir S. Arora. Uses gradient-based and heuristic methods to tune damping and control parameters.
