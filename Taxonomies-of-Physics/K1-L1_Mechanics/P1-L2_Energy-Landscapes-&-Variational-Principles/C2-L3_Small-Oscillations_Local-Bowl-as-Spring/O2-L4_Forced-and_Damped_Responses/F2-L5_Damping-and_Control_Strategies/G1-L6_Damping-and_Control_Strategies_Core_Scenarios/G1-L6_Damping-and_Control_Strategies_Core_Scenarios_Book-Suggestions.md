# G1 Damping and Control Strategies Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

To master fundamental damping add-ons, learners need resources that pair physical intuition with simple design tables. These books explain how tuned dampers and basic feedback rules tame oscillations without overwhelming math.

## Passive Damping References
- *Vibration Absorbers: Devices and Applications* — P. R. White. Surveys tuned mass dampers, viscoelastic pads, and design ratios for classroom-scale experiments.
- *Engineering Vibration Control* — F. S. Tse. Presents practical guidelines on selecting dashpot coefficients and comparing energy dissipation metrics across materials.

## Introductory Control Texts
- *Classical Feedback Control with MATLAB* — R. Bishop. Early chapters detail skyhook-style velocity feedback and bode-plot intuition that mirrors servo cart demos.
- *Mechanical Systems: Modelling and Control* — P. C. Hughes. Provides straightforward derivations linking damping ratios to closed-loop pole locations for single-degree systems.

## Case Study Compilations
- *Structural Control: Concepts and Applications* — B. F. Spencer Jr. & S. Nagarajaiah. Includes laboratory examples of tuned dampers on beams and pendulum carts with measured response reductions.
- *Semi-Active Suspension Control* — H. Du & N. Zhang. Highlights skyhook and hybrid damping strategies in ride control test rigs, reinforcing velocity feedback concepts.
