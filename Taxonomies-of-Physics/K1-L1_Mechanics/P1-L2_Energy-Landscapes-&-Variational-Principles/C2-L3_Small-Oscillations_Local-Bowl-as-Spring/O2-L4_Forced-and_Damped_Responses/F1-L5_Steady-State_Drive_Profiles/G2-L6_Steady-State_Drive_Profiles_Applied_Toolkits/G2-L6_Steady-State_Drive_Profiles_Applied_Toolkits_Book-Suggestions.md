# G2 Steady-State Drive Profiles Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Commissioning teams reach for references that translate Bode plots into actionable tuning steps. These books stress instrumentation, curve fitting, and automated reporting for steady drives.

## Frequency Response Measurement
- *Frequency Response Testing: Theory and Practice* — J. P. Den Hartog Jr. Practical coverage of shaker calibration, coherence checks, and acceptance criteria for production sweeps.
- *Dynamic Testing of Structures* — C. R. Farrar & D. A. Jauregui. Guides readers through FRF extraction, noise handling, and uncertainty budgets tailored to steady-state campaigns.

## Parameter Identification & Control
- *System Identification for Mechanical Systems* — L. Ljung & T. Glad. Presents least-squares and frequency-domain fitting methods for estimating mass, damping, and stiffness from measured FRFs.
- *Active Vibration Control* — A. Preumont. Connects frequency-response data to controller synthesis, notch filters, and adaptive feedforward routines.

## Spectral Analysis References
- *Random Data: Analysis and Measurement Procedures* — J. S. Bendat & A. G. Piersol. Supplies RMS integration formulas and case studies for mixed deterministic and broadband forcing.
- *Practical Machinery Vibration Analysis and Predictive Maintenance* — C. Scheffer & P. Girdhar. Provides templates for reporting vibration levels, trending, and acceptance thresholds in industrial settings.
