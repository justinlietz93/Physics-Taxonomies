# G1 Steady-State Drive Profiles Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Learners exploring steady sinusoidal forcing benefit from references that pair analytical response plots with bench experiments. These texts keep the focus on interpreting amplitude and phase traces.

## Introductory Dynamics Guides
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — S. S. Rao. Detailed chapters on frequency response curves, phase evolution, and examples that mirror classroom sweep labs.
- *Engineering Vibration* — D. J. Inman. Provides step-by-step derivations of harmonic response plus example problems comparing measured and theoretical Bode plots.

## Experiment Companion Manuals
- *Laboratory Experiments in Vibration* — J. R. Wright. Offers turnkey labs on sinusoidal excitation, instrumentation diagrams, and data reduction tips for phase lag estimation.
- *Frequency Response Testing in Practice* — B. Ewins. Bridges theory with practical sweep execution, including shaker setup and averaging strategies.

## Signal Processing Support
- *Signals and Systems for Mechanical Engineers* — C. C. Marple. Builds the Fourier intuition needed to decompose square and sawtooth drives into harmonic content.
- *Understanding FFT Applications* — E. O. Brigham. Guides students through FFT-based amplitude and phase extraction used in modern data acquisitions.
