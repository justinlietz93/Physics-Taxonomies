# F1 Steady-State Drive Profiles — Book Suggestions

These titles focus on harmonic excitation, steady-state amplitude control, and design charts for forced vibration problems.

## Core Vibration References
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Presents frequency-response functions and resonance management strategies.
- *Fundamentals of Vibrations* — Leonard Meirovitch. Derives steady-state solutions using phasors and complex impedance.

## Experimental and Design Manuals
- *Random Vibrations: Theory and Practice* — Paul H. Wirsching, Thomas L. Paez & Keith Ortiz. Includes steady harmonic forcing cases alongside stochastic drives.
- *Shock and Vibration Handbook* — Harris & Piersol. Provides engineering data for shaker tables and drive profile selection.

## Control-Oriented Perspectives
- *Vibration Control of Active Structures* — Andrzej Preumont. Links frequency-response shaping to actuator placement and sensor feedback.
- *Practical Machinery Vibration Analysis and Predictive Maintenance* — Cornelius Scheffer & Paresh Girdhar. Uses drive-response plots for rotating equipment diagnostics.
