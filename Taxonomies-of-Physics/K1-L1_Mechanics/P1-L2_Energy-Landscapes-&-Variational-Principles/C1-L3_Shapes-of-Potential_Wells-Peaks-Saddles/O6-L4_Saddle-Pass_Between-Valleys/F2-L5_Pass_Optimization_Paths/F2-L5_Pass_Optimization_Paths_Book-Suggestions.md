# F2 Pass Optimization Paths — Book Suggestions

Optimization specialists blend variational theory, optimal control, and transport analysis to streamline crossings through saddle passes.

## Variational & Optimal Control Foundations
- *Optimal Control and Estimation* — Robert Stengel. Introduces Pontryagin’s principle, switching functions, and constraint handling for energy-pass steering.
- *Calculus of Variations* — Gelfand & Fomin. Supplies Euler–Lagrange derivations and second-variation tests essential for verifying minimal paths.

## Energy Landscape Engineering
- *Energy Landscapes* — David Wales. Discusses path optimization, barrier sensitivity, and control of saddle locations across molecular and mechanical systems.
- *Optimal Transport: Old and New* — Cédric Villani. Provides mathematical tools for Wasserstein costs and mass transport formulations applied to pass smoothing.

## Applications & Computational Recipes
- *Optimal Control Applications in Chemical and Biological Processes* — Vassiliadis & Pantelides. Presents case studies where control inputs reshape transition pathways and minimize dissipation.
- *Numerical Optimization* — Jorge Nocedal & Stephen Wright. Offers gradient-based and constrained optimization algorithms used to refine transition passes in high-dimensional settings.
