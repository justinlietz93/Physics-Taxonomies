# G2 Pass Optimization Paths Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Software teams implement saddle-connecting algorithms with step-size control, reparameterization, and convergence tests.

## Computational Toolkits
* *Practical Methods of Optimization* — Fletcher. Discusses adaptive steps and convergence criteria for path optimization.
* *Free Energy Calculations* — Chipot & Pohorille. Offers implementation detail for string and nudged elastic band algorithms.
## Software Engineering References
* *Numerical Recipes* — Press et al. Provides pseudo-code for arc-length reparameterization and force projection routines.
* *Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database* — NIST. Supplies benchmark pathways to validate implementations.
