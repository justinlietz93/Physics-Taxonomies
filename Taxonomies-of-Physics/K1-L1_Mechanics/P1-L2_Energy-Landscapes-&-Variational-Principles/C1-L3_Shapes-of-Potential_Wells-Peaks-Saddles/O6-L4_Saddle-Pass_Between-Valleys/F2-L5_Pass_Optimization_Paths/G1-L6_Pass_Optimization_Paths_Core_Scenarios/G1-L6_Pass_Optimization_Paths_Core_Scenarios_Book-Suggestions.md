# G1 Pass Optimization Paths Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Routing problems across a saddle seek the least-action path connecting wells. Core scenarios rely on gradient descent along collective coordinates.

## Least Action Methods
* *Variational Principles in Physics* — Rayner. Introduces action minimization tools for mechanical paths.
* *Energy Landscapes* — David J. Wales. Provides core examples of finding saddle connections in molecular systems.
## Optimization Tutorials
* *Numerical Optimization* — Nocedal & Wright. Covers gradient-based path updates and convergence analysis.
* *Minimum Energy Paths for Proteins* — Wales. Reviews string and nudged elastic band methods for saddle crossing.
