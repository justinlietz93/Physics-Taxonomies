# G2 Activation Barrier Workflows — Book Suggestions

Chemists and materials scientists quantify how often systems cross a saddle by computing activation energies and attempt rates.

## Reaction Rate Foundations
* *Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics* — Steinfeld, Francisco, & Hase. Derives Arrhenius and transition-state expressions used in activation workflows.
* *Kramers' Escape Problem* — Hänggi, Talkner, & Borkovec. Classic review on barrier crossing in noisy systems.
## Computational Toolkits
* *Free Energy Calculations* — Chipot & Pohorille. Provides numerical methods for estimating $E_{a}$ and $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$.
* *Transition Path Sampling* — Dellago, Bolhuis, & Geissler. Guides sampling of rare crossing trajectories in complex landscapes.
