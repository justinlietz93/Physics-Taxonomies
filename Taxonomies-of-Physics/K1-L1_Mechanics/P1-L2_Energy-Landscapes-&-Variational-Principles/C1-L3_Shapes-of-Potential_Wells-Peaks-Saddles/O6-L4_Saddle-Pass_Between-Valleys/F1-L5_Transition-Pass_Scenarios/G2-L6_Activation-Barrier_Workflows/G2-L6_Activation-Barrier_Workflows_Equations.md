# G2 Activation Barrier Workflows â€” Core Equations

Chemists and materials scientists quantify how often systems cross a saddle by computing activation energies and attempt rates.

## Arrhenius Rate
**Gives the escape frequency over the barrier.**

$$k = \\nu_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$

- $\nu_{0}$ is the attempt frequency, $E_{a}$ the activation energy from the saddle height, $k_{B}$ Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ temperature.
## Transition State Theory Flux
**Relates barrier properties to reaction rate.**

$$k = \\frac{k_{B} T}{h} \\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{r}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$

- Partition functions $Q^{\ddagger}$ and $Q_{r}$ capture states near the saddle and reactants; $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ is the free-energy barrier.
## Barrier Lowering by Field
**Estimates how an external force tilts the landscape.**

$$E_{a,eff} = E_{a} - F_{ext} \\Delta x$$

- A driving force $F_{ext}$ acting over displacement $\Delta x$ reduces the barrier, accelerating transitions.
