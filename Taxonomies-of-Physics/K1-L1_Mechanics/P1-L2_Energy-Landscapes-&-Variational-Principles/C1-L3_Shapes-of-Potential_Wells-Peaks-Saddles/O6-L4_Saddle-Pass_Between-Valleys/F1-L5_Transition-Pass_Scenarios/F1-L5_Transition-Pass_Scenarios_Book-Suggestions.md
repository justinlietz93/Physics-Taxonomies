# F1 Transition Pass Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Practitioners need resources that cover saddle hunting, transition pathways, and rate predictions for systems crossing energy passes.

## Theory & Methods
- *Transition State Theory* — Razavy. Offers comprehensive derivations of saddle-point approximations, committor analysis, and rate expressions for barrier crossings.
- *Theoretical Chemistry for Advanced Practice* — Schatz & Ratner. Provides minimum-energy-path and Hessian-analysis recipes applicable to mechanical or chemical passes.

## Computational Toolkits
- *The Art of Molecular Dynamics Simulation* — D. C. Rapaport. Covers nudged elastic band, string methods, and committor evaluations for multidimensional energy landscapes.
- *Free Energy Calculations* — Chipot & Pohorille. Presents umbrella sampling and transition path sampling protocols for quantifying flux through saddles.

## Experimental & Applied Case Studies
- *Protein Folding Funnels* — Ken Dill & H. Chan (Annual Review). Illustrates how saddle passes govern folding routes, with measurement approaches transferable to mechanical landscapes.
- *Energy Landscapes of Clusters* — Jonathan Doye et al. Demonstrates experimental and computational collaborations that map saddles and passes in nanoscale systems.
