# G1 Pass Map Visualizations — Book Suggestions

Saddle passes show how particles or hikers traverse between wells. Visualizers plot contour maps using these gradient relations.

## Visualization Guides
* *Scientific Visualization: Principles and Practice* — Hansen & Johnson. Explains contour and gradient plotting for energy landscapes.
* *Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering* — Riley, Hobson, & Bence. Reviews Hessians and critical point classification.
## Mountain Pass Analogies
* *The Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control* — Liberzon. Illustrates saddle passes in action using path-planning examples.
* *Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos* — Wiggins. Discusses saddle connections with visual diagrams.
