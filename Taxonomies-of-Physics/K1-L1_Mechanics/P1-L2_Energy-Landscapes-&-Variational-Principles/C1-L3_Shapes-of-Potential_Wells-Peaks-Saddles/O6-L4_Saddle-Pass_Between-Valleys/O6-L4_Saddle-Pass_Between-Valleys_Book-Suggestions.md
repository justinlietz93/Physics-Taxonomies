# O6 Saddle Pass Between Valleys — Book Suggestions

Saddles connect basins and host transition states. These references explain how to locate and characterize saddles that mediate escape between valleys.

## Mathematical Foundations
- *Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos* — Stephen Wiggins. Provides invariant manifold theory for saddles and separatrices.
- *Differential Topology* — Victor Guillemin & Alan Pollack. Covers Morse theory classification of index-one saddles.

## Chemical & Materials Transitions
- *Energy Landscapes: Applications to Clusters, Biomolecules and Glasses* — David J. Wales. Details saddle point searches and transition pathways between minima.
- *Theoretical Methods in Condensed Phase Chemistry* — Stuchebrukhov & Hammes-Schiffer. Discusses nudged elastic band and string methods for saddle locating.

## Mechanical & Structural Passes
- *Bifurcation and Chaos in Engineering* — Hamid Reza Noori & Subhankar Ray. Uses saddles in load-deflection curves to explain snap-through and buckling.
- *Geometric Mechanics and Symmetry* — Holm, Schmah, & Stoica. Treats saddle connections in mechanical systems with constraints.
