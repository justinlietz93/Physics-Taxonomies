# O11 Smooth vs Piecewise Potential — Book Suggestions

Some wells are analytic and smooth; others are stitched piecewise with kinks or discontinuities. These references contrast both styles and their modeling impacts.

## Smooth Potentials
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein et al. Derives potentials from Lagrangians assuming differentiability.
- *Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences* — Mary L. Boas. Provides Taylor expansion tools that rely on smoothness.

## Piecewise & Nonsmooth Models
- *Non-smooth Mechanics* — Bernard Brogliato. Covers potentials with corners, impacts, and dry friction that break differentiability.
- *Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos* — Stephen Wiggins. Discusses Poincaré maps and discontinuities in piecewise systems.

## Numerical Handling
- *Computational Methods for Mechanics of Materials* — Sun & Vemaganti. Shows how to treat piecewise potentials in finite element simulations.
- *Numerical Recipes* — Press et al. Describes smoothing, regularization, and interpolation strategies for nonsmooth data.
