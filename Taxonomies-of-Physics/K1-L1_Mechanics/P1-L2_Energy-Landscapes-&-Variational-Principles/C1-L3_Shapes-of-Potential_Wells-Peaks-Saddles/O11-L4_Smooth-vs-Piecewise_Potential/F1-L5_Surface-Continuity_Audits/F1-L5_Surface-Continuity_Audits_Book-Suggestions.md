# F1 Surface Continuity Audits — Book Suggestions

These references teach how to diagnose smoothness, match derivatives, and regularize piecewise-defined potentials.

## Mathematical Background
- *Advanced Calculus of Several Variables* — C. H. Edwards Jr. Covers continuity, differentiability, and Taylor expansions for multivariable functions used in potential audits.
- *Partial Differential Equations* — Lawrence C. Evans. Discusses smoothness requirements for potentials solving Poisson or Laplace equations.

## Applied Mechanics Contexts
- *Contact Mechanics* — K. L. Johnson. Highlights consequences of kinks and slope changes in piecewise contact potentials.
- *Finite Element Procedures* — Klaus-Jürgen Bathe. Explains how shape functions enforce continuity across elements and how to detect discontinuities in numerical models.

## Signal Processing and Smoothing
- *Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing* — William H. Press et al. Provides smoothing kernels and differentiation schemes for noisy potential data.
- *Practical Data Analysis for Scientists and Engineers* — Edward S. Ross. Discusses continuity checks and derivative estimation in experimental data sets.
