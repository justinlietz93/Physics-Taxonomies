# G2 Piecewise Jump Diagnostics — Book Suggestions

Analyzing piecewise potentials requires knowledge of discontinuities, hysteresis, and numerical smoothing. These books cover those themes.

## Discontinuity Analysis
- *Advanced Engineering Mathematics* — Erwin Kreyszig. Contains sections on piecewise functions, jump conditions, and Fourier convergence.
- *Calculus of Discontinuities* — Raymond A. Ryan. Focuses on matching conditions and distributional derivatives.

## Hysteresis & Impacts
- *Hysteresis in Magnetism* — Giorgio Bertotti. Provides theoretical tools for energy-loss integrals around jumps.
- *Impact Mechanics* — C. A. Brebbia & G. Dominguez. Discusses impulsive forces and momentum changes across discontinuities.

## Numerical Treatment
- *Spectral Methods in MATLAB* — Lloyd N. Trefethen. Shows how smoothing filters prevent Gibbs oscillations near jumps.
- *Computational Contact Mechanics* — Peter Wriggers. Presents algorithms for handling force discontinuities in simulations.
