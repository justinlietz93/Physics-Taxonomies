# F2 Cornered vs Smooth Consequences — Book Suggestions

These resources highlight the physical implications of kinks, corners, and smoothing in mechanical potentials.

## Mechanics and Contact Phenomena
- *Dynamics of Mechanical Systems* — Harold Josephs & Ronald Huston. Discusses momentum impulses and discontinuities arising from piecewise forces.
- *Impact Dynamics* — Jerry H. Ginsberg & Christopher D. Rahn. Examines how sharp force transitions affect collision modeling and energy transfer.

## Numerical Modeling
- *The Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis* — Thomas J. R. Hughes. Covers enforcing continuity across elements and dealing with geometric corners.
- *Computational Contact Mechanics* — Peter Wriggers. Addresses smoothing strategies for contact potentials that would otherwise produce infinite forces.

## Experimental Diagnostics
- *Surface Metrology for Micro- and Nanofabrication* — David J. Whitehouse. Explains measurement techniques for detecting geometric corners and transitions that impact potential smoothness.
- *Engineering Tribology* — Gwidon W. Stachowiak & Andrew W. Batchelor. Connects piecewise interaction potentials to frictional behavior and wear experiments.
