# G1 Cornered vs Smooth Consequences Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These titles emphasize how shape differences influence response, dissipation, and spectra.

## Nonlinear Oscillations & Friction
- *Stick-Slip and Friction Induced Vibration* — Jérôme A. C. Guesdon. Discusses dry-friction-like effects that resemble cornered potentials.
- *Nonlinear Oscillations* — Nayfeh & Mook. Covers harmonic generation and effective stiffness changes in nonsmooth systems.

## Signal Analysis
- *Fourier Analysis and Its Applications* — Gerald B. Folland. Provides the tools to interpret harmonic content arising from corners.
- *Spectral Analysis for Physical Applications* — Donald B. Percival & Andrew T. Walden. Offers practical methods for quantifying higher harmonics.

## Engineering Case Studies
- *Nonlinear Structural Dynamics* — K. W. Larsen & R. J. Leng. Presents examples of structures with corner-type stiffness transitions.
- *Mechanical Vibrations: Modeling and Measurement* — Graham Kelly. Includes laboratory case studies comparing smooth and piecewise stiffness.
