# G1 Cornered vs Smooth Consequences Core Scenarios — Core Equations

Comparing cornered and smooth potentials reveals how discontinuities change forces, energy loss, and response. These equations frame the core contrasts.

## Force Response in Smooth vs. Cornered Wells
**Highlights slope discontinuity effects.**

$$F_{\mathrm{smooth}} = -k x, \quad F_{\mathrm{corner}} = -k x - k_c \operatorname{sign}(x)$$

- Adding a corner term $k_c$ introduces a sudden force flip at $x=0$, illustrating how corners create nonlinearity absent in smooth wells.

## Energy Loss per Cycle with Corner Friction
**Quantifies dissipation unique to cornered potentials.**

$$E_{\mathrm{loss}} = 4 k_c A$$

- The area of the force–displacement loop scales with amplitude $A$, showing how sharp corners mimic dry friction and reduce energy.

## Harmonic Content of Motion
**Compares smooth sinusoidal output with corner-induced harmonics.**

$$x(t) = A \sin \omega t + \sum_{n\,\text{odd}} a_n \sin(n \omega t)$$

- Corners generate higher harmonics $a_n$, while smooth wells remain nearly sinusoidal, clarifying spectral signatures of each case.

## Effective Stiffness Averaging
**Shows how corners change perceived stiffness.**

$$k_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{2A} \int_{-A}^{A} \frac{dF}{dx} dx$$

- Averaging the derivative across the motion range reveals that corners typically soften the average stiffness compared with purely smooth wells.
