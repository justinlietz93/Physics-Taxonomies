# G1 Confining Basin Assessments — Book Suggestions

Analysts decide whether a potential well traps motion by comparing energy to basin depth and tail stiffness.

## Potential Analysis Texts
* *Classical Mechanics* — Goldstein, Poole, & Safko. Discusses energy landscapes and escape conditions.
* *Statistical Mechanics* — Pathria & Beale. Provides Boltzmann weighting tools for confinement assessments.
## Applied Basin Studies
* *Nonlinear Oscillations* — Nayfeh & Mook. Covers basin boundary calculations for mechanical systems.
* *Energy Landscapes* — Wales. Presents algorithms for locating basin depths and saddles.
