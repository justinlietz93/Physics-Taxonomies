# G1 Confining Basin Assessments â€” Core Equations

Analysts decide whether a potential well traps motion by comparing energy to basin depth and tail stiffness.

## Escape Energy
**Defines the minimum energy needed to leave the basin.**

$$E_{escape} = V(x_{saddle}) - V(x_{min})$$

- Subtracting the minimum potential from the saddle value yields the available barrier height.
## Confining Length Scale
**Evaluates how quickly the potential rises away from the minimum.**

$$\\ell = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{k_{eff}}}$$

- With effective stiffness $k_{eff}$, $\ell$ estimates oscillation amplitude before hitting the barrier energy $E$.
## Boltzmann Probability
**Estimates thermal occupation outside the basin.**

$$P(E > E_{escape}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{escape}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$$

- A tiny probability confirms confinement; a larger value signals frequent escapes.
