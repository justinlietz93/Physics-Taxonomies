# G2 Runaway Path Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Unbounded tails mean a system can accelerate away once kinetic energy overcomes friction or drag. Planners quantify runaway distance and time.

## Runaway Hazard References
* *Dynamics of Structures* — Anil K. Chopra. Discusses runaway responses when damping is insufficient.
* *Avalanche Handbook* — McClung & Schaerer. Provides analogies for runaway motion in snowfields.
## Drag and Flow Guides
* *Fluid Mechanics* — Frank White. Supplies drag formulas and terminal velocity derivations.
* *Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics* — Meriam & Kraige. Covers energy methods for motion along unbounded slopes.
