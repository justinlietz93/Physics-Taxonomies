# F2 Tail Design Checks — Book Suggestions

Tail design reviews lean on references that blend asymptotic analysis with practical shaping techniques. These books support teams tuning confinement strength or escape smoothness.

## Analytical Frameworks
- *Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics* — V. I. Arnold. Provides action-angle tools and asymptotic expansions for judging tail stiffness and integrability.
- *Potential Theory in Gravity and Magnetic Applications* — Richard J. Blakely. Offers boundary-matching and multipole methods to sculpt long-range tails.

## Engineering Design Sources
- *Designing with Active Materials: An Emerging Technology* — Gould & Lazarescu. Explains how piezo, magnetostrictive, and shape-memory components can impose custom tail forces.
- *Handbook of Mechanical Design* — Shigley, Mischke & Budynas. Supplies safety-factor and margin calculations for components relying on tailored potential envelopes.

## Experimental Validation & Case Work
- *Atomic Force Microscopy: Understanding Basic Modes and Advanced Applications* — Bert Voigtländer. Demonstrates calibration and tail-shaping in nanoscale traps where confinement margins are tight.
- *Traps for Neutral Atoms and Ions* — Metcalf & van der Straten. Covers optical and electromagnetic tail engineering for holding or releasing particles with precision.
