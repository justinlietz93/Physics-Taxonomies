# O8 Confining vs Unbounded Tails — Book Suggestions

The asymptotic behavior of potentials determines whether trajectories remain trapped. These references contrast confining growth with runaway tails.

## Mathematical Physics
- *Classical Mechanics with Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control* — L. Elsgolc. Explains growth conditions for confining potentials in variational problems.
- *Principles of Quantum Mechanics* — R. Shankar. Discusses bound vs continuum spectra depending on potential tails.

## Atomic & Molecular Potentials
- *Molecular Quantum Mechanics* — Atkins & Friedman. Compares confining Morse and Lennard-Jones wells with dissociative tails.
- *Introduction to Atomic Spectra* — White. Highlights how Coulombic \(1/r\) tails produce unbound ionization continua.

## Statistical & Stochastic Motion
- *Statistical Mechanics of Nonequilibrium Liquids* — Evans & Morriss. Treats confinement requirements for well-defined steady states.
- *Diffusion and Reactions in Fractals and Disordered Systems* — Havlin & Ben-Avraham. Examines escape in power-law and logarithmic tails.
