# G2 Coupled Response Troubleshooting — Book Suggestions

When mixed partials are nonzero, technicians quantify cross-coupling to remove unwanted interactions.

## Coupling Diagnostics
* *Mechanical Vibrations* — Rao. Explains mode mixing angles and decoupling matrices.
* *Linear System Theory* — Chen. Covers state transformations to remove cross terms.
## Practical Mitigation
* *Active Vibration Control* — Inman. Details shunt and feedback strategies for coupled structures.
* *Precision Machine Design* — Slocum. Discusses mechanical decoupling using flexures and isolation stages.
