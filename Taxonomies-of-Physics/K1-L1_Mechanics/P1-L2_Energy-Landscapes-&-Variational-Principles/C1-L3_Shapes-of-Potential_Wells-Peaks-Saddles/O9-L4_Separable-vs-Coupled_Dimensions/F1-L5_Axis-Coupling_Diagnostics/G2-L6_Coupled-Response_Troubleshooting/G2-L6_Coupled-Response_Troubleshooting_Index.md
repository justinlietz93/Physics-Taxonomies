# G2-L6_Coupled-Response_Troubleshooting — Genus Index
**Definition:** Troubleshooting routines that detect and mitigate cross-coupled dynamics in multi-axis systems.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Quadcopter_Cross-Coupling_Tune** — Drone technicians tune flight controllers so a roll command doesn’t unintentionally add yaw.
- **S2-L7_VR_Motion-Platform_Coupling_Fix** — Simulator crews adjust actuators so surge motions don’t leak into sway on VR platforms.
