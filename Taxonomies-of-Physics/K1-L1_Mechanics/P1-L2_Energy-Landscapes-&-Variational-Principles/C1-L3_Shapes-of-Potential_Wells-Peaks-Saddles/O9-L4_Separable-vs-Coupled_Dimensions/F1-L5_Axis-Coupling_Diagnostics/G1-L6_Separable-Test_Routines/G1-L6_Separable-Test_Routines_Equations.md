# G1 Separable Test Routines â€” Core Equations

Modelers determine whether multi-dimensional potentials factorize into independent axes.

## Mixed Partial Test
**Confirms absence of coupling between coordinates.**

$$\\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 0$$

- Zero mixed partial derivatives indicate separable structure in orthogonal coordinates.
## Potential Decomposition
**Expresses the potential as a sum of single-variable terms.**

$$V(x,y) = V_{x}(x) + V_{y}(y)$$

- If $V$ can be written as independent contributions, separation is confirmed and simplifies simulation.
## Normal Mode Frequencies
**Matches measured oscillations to separable predictions.**

$$\\omega_{i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}}{m_{i}}}$$

- Decoupled axes each have their own stiffness $k_{i}$ and effective mass $m_{i}$, producing independent frequencies.
