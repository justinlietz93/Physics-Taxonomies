# F1 Axis Coupling Diagnostics — Book Suggestions

These books equip teams to detect and measure cross-axis couplings in multivariate energy landscapes.

## Mathematical Foundations
- *Matrix Analysis of Structures* — Asghar Bhatti. Provides stiffness-matrix formulations and eigenvalue diagnostics for coupled mechanical systems.
- *Perturbation Methods* — E. J. Hinch. Covers asymptotic expansions that tease out small coupling effects and secular growth.

## Testing & Identification
- *Experimental Modal Analysis* — Ewins. Details the measurement workflows for extracting coupled mode shapes and participation factors.
- *System Identification: Theory for the User* — Lennart Ljung. Introduces frequency-response fitting and cross-power tools for quantifying coupling in noisy data.

## Applications & Case Libraries
- *Dynamics of Structures* — Anil K. Chopra. Offers real-world examples where torsion-bending coupling and other interactions must be diagnosed.
- *Vibration Problems in Engineering* — S. Timoshenko & D. H. Young. Compiles classic coupled-oscillator case studies that inform modern diagnostic heuristics.
