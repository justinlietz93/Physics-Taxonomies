# F2 Coupling Mitigation Toolkits — Book Suggestions

These books outline strategies for redesigning or actively controlling systems to suppress unwanted axis coupling.

## Structural & Mechanical Remedies
- *Practical Finite Element Analysis* — Nitin S. Gokhale et al. Shows how to adjust stiffness matrices and boundary conditions to reduce cross-coupling.
- *Structural Dynamics: Theory and Computation* — Mario Paz & William Leigh. Provides modal balancing and tuned-mass approaches for mitigating coupling in built structures.

## Active Control References
- *Multivariable Feedback Control: Analysis and Design* — Skogestad & Postlethwaite. Delivers MIMO control tools for decoupling axes and shaping closed-loop stiffness.
- *Modern Control Engineering* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Covers state feedback, LQR, and observer design techniques widely used in coupling compensation.

## Implementation Case Studies
- *Vibration Control of Active Structures* — André Preumont. Documents real installations of active isolation and counter-coupling in aerospace and precision engineering.
- *Mechatronic System Design: Methods, Models, Concepts* — Devdas Shetty & Richard A. Kolk. Links sensor-actuator layouts with mitigation plans in complex machines.
