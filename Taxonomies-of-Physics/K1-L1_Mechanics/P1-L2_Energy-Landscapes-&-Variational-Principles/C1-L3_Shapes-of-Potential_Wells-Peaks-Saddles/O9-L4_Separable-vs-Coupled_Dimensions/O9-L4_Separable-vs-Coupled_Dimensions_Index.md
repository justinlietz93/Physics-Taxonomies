# O9-L4_Separable-vs-Coupled_Dimensions — Order Index
**Definition:** Terrain sums along axes (separable) or mixes directions (coupled).

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Axis-Coupling_Diagnostics** — tests that reveal whether directions act independently or tug on each other.
- **F2-L5_Coupling_Mitigation_Toolkits** — approaches to decouple axes or harness coupling in energy landscapes.
