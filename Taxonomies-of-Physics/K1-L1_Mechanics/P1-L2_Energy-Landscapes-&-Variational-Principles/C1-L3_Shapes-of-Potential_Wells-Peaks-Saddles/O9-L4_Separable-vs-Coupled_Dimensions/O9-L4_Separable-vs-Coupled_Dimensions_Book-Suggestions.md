# O9 Separable vs Coupled Dimensions — Book Suggestions

Whether a potential separates across coordinates dictates solvability and mode mixing. These resources compare decoupled wells with coupled landscapes.

## Separable Systems
- *Mathematical Methods for Physicists* — Arfken, Weber, & Harris. Reviews separation of variables for multi-dimensional wells.
- *Classical Mechanics* — L. D. Landau & E. M. Lifshitz. Provides canonical transformations to decouple quadratic forms.

## Coupled Dynamics
- *Coupled Oscillations and Waves* — B. Andrey. Explores mode mixing and avoided crossings when coupling terms appear.
- *Normal Modes and Symmetry* — Michael Tinkham. Uses group theory to manage coupling in molecular and solid-state contexts.

## Numerical Diagonalization
- *Computational Physics* — Mark Newman. Demonstrates matrix diagonalization for coupled potentials and normal-mode extraction.
- *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics in Chemistry* — Mark A. Ratner & George C. Schatz. Applies product basis truncations to treat coupled wells.
