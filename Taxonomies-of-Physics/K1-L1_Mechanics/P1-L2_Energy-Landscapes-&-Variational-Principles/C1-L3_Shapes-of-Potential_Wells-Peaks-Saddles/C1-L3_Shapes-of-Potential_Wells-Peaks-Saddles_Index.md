# C1-L3_Shapes-of-Potential_Wells-Peaks-Saddles — Class Index
**Definition:** Survey the landscape geometries—single bowls, double wells, saddles, ridges, and flat stretches—that dictate stability and escape paths.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Order (L4) — index
- **O1-L4_Single-Well_Convex-Minimum** — one stable bowl; curvature sets stiffness and ringdown.
- **O2-L4_Double-Well_Symmetric** — twin valleys split by a ridge; symmetry ready to break.
- **O3-L4_Double-Well_Biased-Asymmetric** — unequal basins favor one state yet allow switching.
- **O4-L4_Multiwell_Periodic-Lattice** — repeating wells build crystals and band structures.
- **O5-L4_Peak_Unstable-Maximum** — a single hilltop where balance is knife-edge unstable.
- **O6-L4_Saddle-Pass_Between-Valleys** — mountain passes that mediate transitions between basins.
- **O7-L4_Flat-Directions_Almost-Plateau** — soft axes give slow drifts or marginal stability.
- **O8-L4_Confining-vs-Unbounded_Tails** — decide whether energy walls confine or let trajectories escape.
- **O9-L4_Separable-vs-Coupled_Dimensions** — independent axes versus intertwined directions.
- **O10-L4_Geometry_1D-2D-3D** — dimensionality alters basin shapes and constraint counts.
- **O11-L4_Smooth-vs-Piecewise_Potential** — differentiable bowls versus sharp corners and kinks.
- **O12-L4_Local-Quadratic_Approximation** — zoom in and replace the shape by its Taylor bowl.
- **O13-L4_Barrier-Height_Regimes_Small-Medium-Large** — ridge height relative to thermal or forcing energy.
- **O14-L4_Symmetry_Preserved-vs-Broken** — how symmetry in the landscape locks or unlocks states.
