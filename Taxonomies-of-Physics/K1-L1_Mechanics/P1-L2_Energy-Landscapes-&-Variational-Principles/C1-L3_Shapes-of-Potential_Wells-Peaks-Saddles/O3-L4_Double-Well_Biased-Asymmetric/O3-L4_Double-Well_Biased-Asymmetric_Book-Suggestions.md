# O3 Double-Well Biased & Asymmetric — Book Suggestions

Biasing one side of a double well introduces preferred states, metastability, and controlled switching. These resources detail how asymmetry modifies dynamics and energetics.

## Deterministic Dynamics
- *Nonlinear Oscillations, Dynamical Systems, and Bifurcations of Vector Fields* — John Guckenheimer & Philip Holmes. Shows how imperfect pitchforks arise from symmetry-breaking bias terms.
- *Advanced Mechanics of Materials and Applied Elasticity* — Ansel C. Ugural & Saul K. Fenster. Uses asymmetric double wells to model snap-through and bistable structures under load.

## Statistical & Chemical Kinetics
- *Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics* — Jeffrey I. Steinfeld, Joseph S. Francisco, & William L. Hase. Treats reaction coordinates with unequal wells, emphasizing transition-state theory with bias.
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — N. G. van Kampen. Analyzes biased escape probabilities and residence times for nonequivalent wells.

## Quantum Landscape Control
- *Quantum Tunnelling in Complex Systems* — S. Takada & S. Kurihara. Discusses driven tunneling when wells differ in depth or curvature.
- *Coherent Control of Molecules* — Moshe Shapiro & Paul Brumer. Describes laser strategies for steering population between unequally weighted wells.
