# G1 Shifted Minima Energy Diagrams â€” Core Equations

Biasing a double well tilts the energy landscape, shifting minima and altering switching thresholds. These equations quantify the diagram features.

## Biased Double-Well Potential
**Adds a linear tilt to the symmetric quartic.**

$$V(x) = a x^4 - b x^2 - F x$$

- The term $-F x$ skews the wells, lowering one minimum and raising the other.

## New Minimum Locations
**Solves for minima under bias.**

$$4a x^3 - 2b x - F = 0$$

- Roots of this cubic give the shifted minima positions, which can be plotted to update energy diagrams.

## Barrier Height Difference
**Measures how bias changes activation energy.**

$$\Delta U = V(x_{\mathrm{saddle}}) - V(x_{\mathrm{low}})$$

- Comparing saddle energy to the lower minimum shows how much drive is needed to transition uphill.

## Occupation Probability Ratio
**Relates diagram asymmetry to state populations.**

$$\frac{P_{\mathrm{high}}}{P_{\mathrm{low}}} = e^{-\Delta U / k_B T}$$

- The ratio translates energy diagram differences into expected occupancy under thermal fluctuations.
