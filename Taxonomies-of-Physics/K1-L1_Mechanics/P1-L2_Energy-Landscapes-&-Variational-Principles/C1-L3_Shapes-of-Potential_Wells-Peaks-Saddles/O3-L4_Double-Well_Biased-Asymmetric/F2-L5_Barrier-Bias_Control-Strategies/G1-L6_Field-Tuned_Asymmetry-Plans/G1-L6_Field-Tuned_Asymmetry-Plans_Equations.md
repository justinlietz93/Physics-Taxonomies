# G1 Field-Tuned Asymmetry Plans â€” Core Equations

External fields or loads can tune asymmetry in double wells. These equations assist in planning how much bias to apply for desired behavior.

## Bias Force Requirement
**Computes field strength for target energy offset.**

$$F = \frac{\Delta U_{\mathrm{target}}}{x_b}$$

- Desired energy difference $\Delta U_{\mathrm{target}}$ divided by barrier position $x_b$ yields the needed force or torque.

## Equilibrium Shift Due to Field
**Relates bias to new minimum position.**

$$x_{\mathrm{eq}} = x_0 + \frac{F}{k_{\mathrm{eff}}}$$

- Effective stiffness $k_{\mathrm{eff}}$ determines how far the equilibrium moves when a bias field is applied.

## Energy Balance Condition
**Ensures lower well remains stable under bias.**

$$\Delta U_{\mathrm{lower}} = \Delta U_0 - F x_b > 0$$

- Keeping this quantity positive prevents the lower well from collapsing, guiding upper limits on bias.

## Sensitivity to Field Variations
**Evaluates how small changes alter asymmetry.**

$$\frac{d\Delta U}{dF} = -x_b$$

- The linear sensitivity indicates that precise control of the applied field directly tunes energy difference by the lever arm $x_b$.
