# F2 Barrier Bias Control Strategies â€” Core Equations

Control engineers monitor how active loads and fields reshape the barrier profile so they can tune switching probability, latency, and energy budgets on demand.

## Tunable Potential Forms
**Effective barrier with control field:**

$$V_{\mathrm{eff}}(x, t) = V_{0}(x) - q E(t) x - M(t) x$$

- Combines the static profile $V_{0}(x)$ with electric field coupling ($qE$) and mechanical torque or stress loads $M(t)$ to capture real-time barrier shaping.

**Instantaneous barrier reduction:**

$$\Delta V(t) = V_{\mathrm{s}}(t) - V_{\mathrm{m}}(t)$$

- Evaluated between the time-dependent saddle and metastable minimum to quantify how actuators lower the escape hurdle.

## Switching Probability Targets
**Driven transition rate (time-dependent Kramers):**

$$k(t) = k_{0} \exp\left[-\frac{\Delta V(t)}{k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{\mathrm{eff}}(t)}\right]$$

- Uses an effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}(t)$ to fold in rapid driving or noise injection when predicting instantaneous switching rates.

**Target success probability over control window:**

$$P_{\mathrm{sw}} = 1 - \exp\left(-\int_{0}^{\tau} k(t)\, dt\right)$$

- Integrating the time-varying rate yields the probability of a completed switch within the programmed pulse duration $\tau$.

## Energy and Bandwidth Budgets
**Work delivered by control channel:**

$$W_{\mathrm{ctrl}} = \int_{0}^{\tau} F_{\mathrm{ctrl}}(t) \, \dot{x}(t)\, dt$$

- Helps balance success probability against the energy invested by the control hardware.

**Spectral content constraint:**

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |E(\omega)|^{2} d\omega \leq B_{\max}$$

- Limits the frequency-weighted drive amplitude to stay within actuator bandwidth or electromagnetic compatibility caps while biasing the barrier.
