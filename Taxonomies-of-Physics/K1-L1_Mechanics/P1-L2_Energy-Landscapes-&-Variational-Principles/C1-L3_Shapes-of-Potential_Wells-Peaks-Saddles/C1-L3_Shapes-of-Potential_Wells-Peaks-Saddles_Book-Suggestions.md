# C1 Shapes of Potential Wells, Peaks & Saddles — Book Suggestions

The geometry of potentials decides whether motion gets trapped, escapes, or balances on a knife-edge. These class-level picks spotlight how curvature, topology, and approximations translate into real physical predictions.

## Landscape Geometry Primers
- *Potential Energy Surfaces and Dynamics Calculations* — Donald Truhlar, Bruce Garrett, & Steven Klippenstein. Walks through how chemists chart multidimensional wells and saddles, with transferable visualization and fitting tactics.
- *Energy Landscapes: Applications to Clusters, Biomolecules and Glasses* — David Wales. Explores minima, transition states, and disconnectivity graphs that map directly onto the class taxonomy.

## Mathematical Foundations
- *Morse Theory* — John Milnor. Presents the critical point classification toolkit for wells, peaks, and saddles that underpins bifurcation inventories.
- *Differential Topology* — Victor Guillemin & Alan Pollack. Supplies the coordinate-free language for manifolds, Hessians, and index counts used in high-dimensional potentials.

## Numerical & Visualization Tools
- *Computational Physics* — Nicholas J. Giordano & Hisao Nakanishi. Demonstrates gridding, finite differences, and relaxation schemes that reveal curvature structure in arbitrary potentials.
- *Visual Complex Analysis* — Tristan Needham. Offers geometric intuition for contour plots, gradient flows, and saddle behavior that complements energy landscape sketches.
