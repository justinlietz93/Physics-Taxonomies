# F2 Plateau Control Plans — Book Suggestions

These titles gather the control theory, instrumentation, and design case studies teams use to keep plateaued systems aligned and responsive.

## Control Theory Foundations
- *Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers* — Åström & Murray. Presents the loop-shaping and stability criteria needed for soft-mode regulation.
- *Applied Nonlinear Control* — Slotine & Li. Supplies nonlinear feedback strategies and Lyapunov tools for taming gentle potential directions that depart from linear models.

## Implementation Playbooks
- *Mechatronics: Dynamics of Electromechanical and Piezoelectric Systems* — Thomas R. Kurfess. Links sensors, actuators, and controller design for precision plateau management.
- *Virtual Work and the Energy Method* — Robert W. Soutas-Little. Shows how energy shaping and virtual stiffness concepts translate into mechanical biasing hardware.

## Monitoring & Case Studies
- *Precision Motion Control: Design and Implementation* — J. Michael Maciejowski et al. Documents nanometer-scale drift suppression tactics, including integral bias cancellation.
- *Nanopositioning Technologies: Fundamentals and Applications* — Chao He & Wen Jung Li. Offers instrumentation and calibration case studies where plateau control plans keep microscopes and probes on target.
