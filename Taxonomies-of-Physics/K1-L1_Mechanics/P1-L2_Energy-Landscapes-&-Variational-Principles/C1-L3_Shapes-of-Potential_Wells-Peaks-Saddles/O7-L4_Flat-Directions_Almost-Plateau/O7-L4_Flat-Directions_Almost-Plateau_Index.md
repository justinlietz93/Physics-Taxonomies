# O7-L4_Flat-Directions_Almost-Plateau — Order Index
**Definition:** Almost flat region; motion is slow and indecisive.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Shallow-Gradient_Drift-Cases** — nearly flat directions where systems drift slowly instead of snapping back.
- **F2-L5_Plateau_Control_Plans** — methods to steer or arrest drift along almost flat landscape directions.
