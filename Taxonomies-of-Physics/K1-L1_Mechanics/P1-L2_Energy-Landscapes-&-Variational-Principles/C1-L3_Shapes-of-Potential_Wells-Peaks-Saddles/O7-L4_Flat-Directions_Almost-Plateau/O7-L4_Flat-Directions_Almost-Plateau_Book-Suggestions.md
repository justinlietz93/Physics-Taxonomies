# O7 Flat Directions & Almost Plateau — Book Suggestions

Nearly flat landscapes host slow modes, marginal stability, and diffusion. These readings explain how to treat soft directions without full confinement.

## Slow Manifold Analysis
- *Multiple Time Scale Dynamics* — Christian Kuehn. Explores slow-fast decompositions that arise when curvature nearly vanishes.
- *Singular Perturbation Methods in Control* — Kokotovic, Khalil, & O'Reilly. Applies slow manifold tools to systems with flat energy directions.

## Glassy & Rugged Landscapes
- *Spin Glass Theory and Beyond* — Mézard, Parisi, & Virasoro. Discusses flat directions in complex energy landscapes and their consequences for dynamics.
- *Principles of Protein Structure, Stability, and Function* — B. Silverman. Highlights quasi-flat funnels in biomolecular folding.

## Diffusive Motion
- *Brownian Motion* — Peter Mörters & Yuval Peres. Treats diffusion along nearly flat potentials and the resulting sub/super-diffusive regimes.
- *Statistical Physics of Particles* — Mehran Kardar. Shows how flat curvature modifies Fokker–Planck solutions and relaxation times.
