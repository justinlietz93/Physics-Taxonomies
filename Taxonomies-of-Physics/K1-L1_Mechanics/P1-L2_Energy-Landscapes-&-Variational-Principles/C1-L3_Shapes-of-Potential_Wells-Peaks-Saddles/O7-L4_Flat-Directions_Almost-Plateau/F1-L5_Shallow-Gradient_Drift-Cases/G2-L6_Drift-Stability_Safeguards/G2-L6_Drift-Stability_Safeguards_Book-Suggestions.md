# G2 Drift Stability Safeguards — Book Suggestions

Engineers protect systems on plateaus by adding bias forces and monitoring slow coordinate creep.

## Stability Engineering
* *Applied Nonlinear Control* — Slotine & Li. Covers adding bias forces and damping to tame weakly stable coordinates.
* *Robust Control Design* — Bhattacharyya et al. Provides margin and monitoring strategies for lightly constrained systems.
## Sensing and Monitoring
* *Sensors and Signal Conditioning* — Pallás-Areny & Webster. Guides selection of resolution and noise floors for drift detection.
* *Handbook of Measurement Science* — Sydenham et al. Discusses long-term stability and recalibration intervals.
