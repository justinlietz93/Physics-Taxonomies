# G2-L6_Drift-Stability_Safeguards — Genus Index
**Definition:** Maintenance practices that monitor and arrest gradual drift along almost-flat plateaus.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Lab_Precision-Stage_Creep-Test** — Metrology labs run overnight creep tests to see if precision stages drift on their flat axes.
- **S2-L7_3D-Printer_Bed_Leveling_Audit** — Makers check print beds so the nearly flat leveling screws don’t let surfaces sag over time.
