# G1 Fine-Tune Modeling Tools — Book Suggestions

Flat directions lead to slow drifts that frustrate tuning. Modelers examine gradients and curvature to isolate the gentle slopes.

## Optimization Diagnostics
* *Trust Region Methods* — Conn, Gould, & Toint. Explains eigenvalue analysis for nearly flat landscapes.
* *Numerical Optimization* — Nocedal & Wright. Discusses projected gradients and preconditioning for ill-conditioned problems.
## Control and Calibration Guides
* *Feedback Systems* — Åström & Murray. Shows how to design controllers for plants with weak restoring forces.
* *Precision Instrumentation and Measurement* — Northrop. Provides calibration strategies for slow-drift systems.
