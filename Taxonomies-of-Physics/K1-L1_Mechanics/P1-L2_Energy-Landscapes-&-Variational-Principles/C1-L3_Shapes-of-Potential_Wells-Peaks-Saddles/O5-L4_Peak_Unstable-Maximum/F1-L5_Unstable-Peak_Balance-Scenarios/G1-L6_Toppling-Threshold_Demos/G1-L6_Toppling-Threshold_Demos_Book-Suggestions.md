# G1 Toppling Threshold Demos — Book Suggestions

Classroom tipping demos hinge on when the center of mass passes beyond the pivot. These relations help presenters script clear visual thresholds.

## Demonstration Playbooks
* *Lecture Demonstration Handbook* — Sutton & Leslie. Offers tipping experiments with timing cues and common student questions.
* *Physics Demonstrations: A Sourcebook for Teachers of Physics* — Julien Clinton Sprott. Provides setup diagrams and safety notes for toppling displays.
## Statics and Stability References
* *Engineering Mechanics: Statics* — Hibbeler. Derives tipping criteria and illustrates how to compute center of mass offsets.
* *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Supplies torque balance worked examples suited to conceptual demos.
