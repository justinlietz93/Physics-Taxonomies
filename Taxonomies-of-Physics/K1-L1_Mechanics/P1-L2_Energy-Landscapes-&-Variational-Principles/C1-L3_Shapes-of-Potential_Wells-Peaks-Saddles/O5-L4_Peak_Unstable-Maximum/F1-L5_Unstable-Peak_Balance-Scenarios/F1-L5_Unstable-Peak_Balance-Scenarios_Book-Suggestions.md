# F1 Unstable Peak Balance Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Balancing atop unstable peaks benefits from references that mix stability theory, inverted-pendulum control, and energy-barrier diagnostics.

## Stability & Dynamics Foundations
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven Strogatz. Explains linearization, Lyapunov exponents, and escape dynamics for equilibria at energy maxima.
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein. Provides Hamiltonian treatments of unstable equilibrium points and energy methods relevant to peak analysis.

## Control & Balancing Techniques
- *Feedback Systems* — Karl Åström & Richard Murray. Supplies PD control design, inverted pendulum examples, and robustness considerations for maintaining unstable positions.
- *Underactuated Robotics* — Russ Tedrake (Course Notes). Presents practical balancing strategies, base acceleration methods, and real-world inverted pendulum case studies.

## Experimental & Safety Guides
- *Active Balancing of Inverted Pendulums* — Ljungqvist & Åström. Focused monograph on sensor requirements, controller tuning, and disturbance rejection for upright balancing rigs.
- *Engineering Vibration* — Daniel Inman. Covers measurement techniques and forced-response calculations that set power budgets for holding systems near unstable peaks.
