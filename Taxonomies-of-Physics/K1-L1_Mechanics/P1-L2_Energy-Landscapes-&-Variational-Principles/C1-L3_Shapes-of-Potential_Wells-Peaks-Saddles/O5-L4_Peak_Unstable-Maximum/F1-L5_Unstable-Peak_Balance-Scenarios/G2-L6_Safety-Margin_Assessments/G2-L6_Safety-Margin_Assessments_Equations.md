# G2 Safety Margin Assessments â€” Core Equations

Designers estimating topple risk need quick factors of safety for shelves, statues, and museum pieces perched on unstable peaks.

## Factor of Safety
**Compares resisting and overturning moments.**

$$FoS = \\frac{M_{resist}}{M_{overturn}} = \\frac{F_{support} h}{m g x_{cm}}$$

- Values above 1 indicate a stable configuration with margin; values near 1 warn of imminent tipping.
## Base Width Requirement
**Finds the minimum footprint to hold the center of mass inside the support polygon.**

$$b_{min} = 2 x_{cm}$$

- For a rectangular base, the projection of the center of mass must stay within $\pm b/2$; double the offset to obtain minimum width.
## Dynamic Amplification
**Accounts for a horizontal shove or gust.**

$$x_{eff} = x_{cm} + \\frac{F_{push}}{m g} h_{cm}$$

- An impulsive lateral force $F_{push}$ shifts the effective line of action by $\frac{F_{push}}{m g} h_{cm}$, reducing stability margin.
