# G2 Peak Stabilization Techniques Applied Toolkits â€” Core Equations

Field engineers translating stabilization plans into hardware rely on quick formulas for fastener loads, ballast sizing, and anchor checks.

## Bolt Shear Demand
**Checks anchor bolts resisting overturning.**

$$V = \\frac{m g x_{cm}}{n r}$$

- $n$ bolts share the overturning moment using radius $r$ to the bolt circle; compare $V$ to allowable shear strength.
## Ballast Block Count
**Calculates how many counterweight blocks to deploy.**

$$N = \\frac{m g x_{cm} - M_{existing}}{w_{block} d}$$

- $M_{existing}$ is any current resisting moment; each block weighs $w_{block}$ and sits at lever arm $d$.
## Cable Sag Allowance
**Ensures pretension stays above minimum after stretch.**

$$\\Delta L = \\frac{T L}{A E}$$

- The elongation $\Delta L$ from load $T$ on length $L$ guides turnbuckle adjustments; $A$ and $E$ are cross-section and modulus.
