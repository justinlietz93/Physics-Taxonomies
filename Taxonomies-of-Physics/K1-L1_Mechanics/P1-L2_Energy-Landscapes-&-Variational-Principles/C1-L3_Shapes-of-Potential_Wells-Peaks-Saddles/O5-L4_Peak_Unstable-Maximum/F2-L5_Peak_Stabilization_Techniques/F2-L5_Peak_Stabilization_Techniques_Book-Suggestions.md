# F2 Peak Stabilization Techniques — Book Suggestions

Stabilization specialists rely on references that unite control synthesis, parametric excitation, and structural tailoring for taming unstable peaks.

## Control Design Playbooks
- *Modern Control Engineering* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Provides linear state-feedback design, pole placement, and robustness metrics tailored to unstable equilibria.
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene Franklin et al. Offers practical gain selection, implementation notes, and disturbance rejection strategies for inverted configurations.

## Vibrational & Energy-Shaping Methods
- *Mechanics of Vibrations* — Rao. Details parametric excitation, Mathieu stability charts, and high-frequency vibration methods for effective potential shaping.
- *Energy Shaping in Nonlinear Control Systems* — Ortega, van der Schaft, & Astolfi. Focused treatment of passivity-based controllers that sculpt energy landscapes around unstable peaks.

## Applications & Case Studies
- *The Inverted Pendulum: Engineering Applications* — Vladimir Belyakov. Compiles experimental setups using feedback and vibration control to stabilize peak-balanced systems.
- *Compliant Mechanisms* — Larry Howell. Demonstrates how compliant elements reconfigure curvature and stiffness to flatten peaks in mechanical assemblies.
