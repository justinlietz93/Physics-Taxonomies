# O5 Peak Unstable Maximum — Book Suggestions

Peaks represent unstable equilibria where trajectories depart exponentially. These references show how to analyze maxima, barriers, and inverted potentials.

## Stability & Linearization
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Discusses stability classification using eigenvalues, including unstable maxima in potential surfaces.
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Fowles & Cassiday. Covers energy methods and inverted pendulum examples that embody peaks.

## Control & Stabilization
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene F. Franklin, J. David Powell, & Abbas Emami-Naeini. Illustrates how actuators stabilize inherently unstable equilibria like inverted pendulums.
- *Nonlinear Systems* — Hassan K. Khalil. Provides Lyapunov and feedback linearization tools for controlling dynamics near maxima.

## Thermally Activated Escape
- *The Theory of Rate Processes* — Sidney Redner. Explains how particles surmount energy peaks via thermal fluctuations.
- *Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics* — R. Zwanzig. Introduces projection methods to estimate escape dynamics from unstable tops.
