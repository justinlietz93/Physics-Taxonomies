# G1 Softening Period Tuning â€” Core Equations

Softening wells bend outward at large amplitudes, lengthening oscillation periods. These equations help storytellers quantify the amplitude dependence.

## Duffing Softening Model
**Captures the leading cubic correction to the restoring force.**

$$\ddot{x} + 2\zeta\omega_0 \dot{x} + \omega_0^2 x + \alpha x^3 = 0, \quad \alpha < 0$$

- The negative cubic coefficient $\alpha$ represents softening behavior, reminding audiences that stiffness drops as displacement grows.

## Amplitude-Dependent Frequency
**Approximates the period shift for small nonlinearity.**

$$\omega \approx \omega_0 + \frac{3\alpha A^2}{8\omega_0}$$

- Because $\alpha$ is negative, the correction term reduces $\omega$ with amplitude $A$, helping demonstrations predict slower beats at larger swings.

## Energy-Amplitude Relation
**Links initial energy to the oscillation amplitude.**

$$E = \tfrac{1}{2}kA^2 + \tfrac{1}{4}\alpha A^4$$

- This expression lets experimenters estimate amplitude from energy input, clarifying why moderate drives push the system deeper into the softening regime.

## Period Stretch Percentage
**Expresses the frequency shift as a percent change.**

$$\frac{T - T_0}{T_0} \approx -\frac{3\alpha A^2}{8\omega_0^2}$$

- Converting to period highlights how a given amplitude inflates timing, offering a quick check when comparing to the harmonic baseline $T_0$.
