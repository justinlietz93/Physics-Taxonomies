# G1 Softening Period Tuning — Book Suggestions

Readers exploring softening oscillators need guides on Duffing systems, nonlinear vibrations, and experimental identification of amplitude-dependent periods.

## Nonlinear Oscillation Theory
- *Nonlinear Oscillations* — Ali H. Nayfeh & Dean T. Mook. Provides detailed treatments of softening Duffing systems and perturbation methods for frequency shifts.
- *Applied Nonlinear Dynamics* — Ali H. Nayfeh & Bala Balachandran. Covers averaging and multiple scales applied to mechanical softening problems.

## Experimental Perspectives
- *Nonlinear System Identification* — Johan Schoukens & Rik Pintelon. Teaches how to extract amplitude-dependent frequency responses from measurements.
- *Mechanical Vibrations: Theory and Practice* — S. Graham Kelly. Includes chapters on nonlinear stiffness and methods to quantify period elongation.

## Engineering Applications
- *Vibration of Continuous Systems* — Singiresu S. Rao. Discusses softening effects in beams and plates relevant to large-amplitude deflections.
- *Dynamics of Structures* — Anil K. Chopra. Highlights tuning of nonlinear isolators and base-isolation devices that exhibit softening behavior.
