# G2 Thermal Drift Guardians — Book Suggestions

Guarding against thermal drift requires insight into materials, temperature control, and feedback. These books provide actionable knowledge.

## Materials & Expansion
- *Thermal Expansion of Solids* — C.Y. Ho. A comprehensive reference on coefficients of thermal expansion for engineering materials.
- *Engineering Materials 1* — Michael F. Ashby & David R.H. Jones. Explains thermal properties and selection strategies for low-drift structures.

## Temperature Control
- *Thermal Measurements in Electronics* — Hal J. Marcy. Covers enclosure design, heaters, and sensors for maintaining stable temperatures.
- *Practical Temperature Control* — Robert V. Olsson. Presents PID tuning and implementation tips for slow thermal systems.

## Feedback & Metrology
- *Precision Temperature Measurement* — Thomas Quinn. Discusses uncertainty budgets and sensor placement for drift monitoring.
- *Modern Control Systems* — Richard C. Dorf & Robert H. Bishop. Provides integral-action design techniques to cancel steady drifts in precision stages.
