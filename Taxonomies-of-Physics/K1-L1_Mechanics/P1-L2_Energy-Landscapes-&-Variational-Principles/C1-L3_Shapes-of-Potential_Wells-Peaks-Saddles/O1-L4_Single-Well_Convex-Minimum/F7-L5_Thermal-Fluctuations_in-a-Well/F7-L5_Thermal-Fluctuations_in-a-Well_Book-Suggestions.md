# F7 Thermal Fluctuations in a Well — Book Suggestions

These books explain thermal noise, Langevin dynamics, and experimental trapping techniques relevant to single-well fluctuations.

## Statistical Mechanics Foundations
- *Statistical Physics, Part 1* — Lev Landau & Evgeny Lifshitz. Presents Boltzmann distributions and fluctuation–dissipation relations for harmonic wells.
- *An Introduction to Thermal Physics* — Daniel V. Schroeder. Offers accessible derivations of equipartition and energy fluctuations for students.

## Noise and Stochastic Processes
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — N. G. van Kampen. Develops Langevin and Fokker–Planck descriptions for overdamped wells.
- *Statistical Physics of Particles* — Mehran Kardar. Discusses escape rates, correlation functions, and thermally driven motion in confining potentials.

## Experimental Contexts
- *Optical Tweezers: Principles and Applications* — Philip H. Jones, Onofrio M. Maragò, & Giovanni Volpe. Shows how thermal motion in harmonic traps calibrates stiffness and measures microscopic forces.
- *Microscale and Nanoscale Heat Transfer* — C. Sobhan & G. P. Peterson. Includes Brownian motion measurements and thermal noise considerations for small mechanical systems.
