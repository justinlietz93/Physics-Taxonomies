# F9 Adiabatic Parameter Sweep Tracking the Minimum — Book Suggestions

These texts examine slowly varying Hamiltonians, quasi-static loading, and control of moving equilibria in single-well systems.

## Analytical Background
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein. Includes action–angle and adiabatic invariants for slowly driven oscillators.
- *Perturbation Methods* — Ali H. Nayfeh. Provides multiple-scale treatments for systems with slowly changing parameters.

## Experimental and Control Insights
- *Smart Materials and Structures* — Azim H. Hussain & Nasimuddin. Discusses quasi-static actuator sweeps and hysteresis minimization in piezoelectric positioning stages.
- *Adaptive Structures: Mechanics and Control* — M. I. Friswell et al. Explains tracking algorithms and lag compensation for moving equilibria.

## Numerical and Computational Tools
- *Time-Dependent Mechanics and Spatial Structure* — C. G. J. Jacobi (translated modern edition). Offers variational approaches to time-dependent constraints and moving potentials.
- *Geometric Numerical Integration* — Ernst Hairer, Christian Lubich, & Gerhard Wanner. Shows how symplectic and energy-preserving algorithms capture adiabatic invariants in simulations.
