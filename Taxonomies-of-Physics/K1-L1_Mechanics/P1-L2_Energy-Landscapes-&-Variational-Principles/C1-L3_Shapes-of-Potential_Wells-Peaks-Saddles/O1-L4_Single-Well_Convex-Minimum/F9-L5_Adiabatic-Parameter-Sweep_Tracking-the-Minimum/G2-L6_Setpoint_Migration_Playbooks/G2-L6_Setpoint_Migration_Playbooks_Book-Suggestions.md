- *Motion Control Systems* — Asif Sabanovic et al. Provides motion-profile design tools for smooth setpoint migration.

## Feedforward & Control
- *Feedforward Control* — Henning O. F. Ohlsson & Jan Åkesson. Explains how to compute bias commands and compensate predictable motion.
- *Advanced Control Engineering* — Roland S. Burns. Covers combined feedforward/feedback schemes with practical tuning advice.

## Automation & Implementation
- *Programmable Logic Controllers* — Frank D. Petruzella. Offers scripting strategies for industrial ramp sequences and interlocks.
- *Practical Industrial Data Communications* — Deon Reynders et al. Details networking and logging considerations for automated setpoint moves.
