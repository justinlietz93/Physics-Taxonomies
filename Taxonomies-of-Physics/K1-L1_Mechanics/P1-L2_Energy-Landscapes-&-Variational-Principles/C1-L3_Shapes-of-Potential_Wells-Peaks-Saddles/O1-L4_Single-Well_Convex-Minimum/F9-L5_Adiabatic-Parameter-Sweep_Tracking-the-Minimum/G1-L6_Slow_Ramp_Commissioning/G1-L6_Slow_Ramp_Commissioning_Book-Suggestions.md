# G1 Slow Ramp Commissioning — Book Suggestions

Commissioning adiabatic sweeps combines quasi-static mechanics, instrumentation, and control. These books provide the relevant background.

## Slow Dynamics & Adiabatic Theory
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein et al. Discusses adiabatic invariants and slow parameter changes in harmonic systems.
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven Strogatz. Offers intuition on time-scale separation and adiabatic following in simple models.

## Instrumentation Practices
- *Experimental Methods for Engineers* — J.P. Holman. Covers slow ramp procedures, data logging, and uncertainty estimation.
- *Data Acquisition and Control Handbook* — Robert G. Seippel. Provides guidance on setting ramp profiles and monitoring instrumentation drift.

## Control & Automation
- *Process Dynamics and Control* — Dale E. Seborg et al. Explains ramp control, integral action, and tracking error management in slow processes.
- *Practical PID Control* — Antonio Visioli. Gives tuning recipes for gentle ramps and minimizing lag during commissioning.
