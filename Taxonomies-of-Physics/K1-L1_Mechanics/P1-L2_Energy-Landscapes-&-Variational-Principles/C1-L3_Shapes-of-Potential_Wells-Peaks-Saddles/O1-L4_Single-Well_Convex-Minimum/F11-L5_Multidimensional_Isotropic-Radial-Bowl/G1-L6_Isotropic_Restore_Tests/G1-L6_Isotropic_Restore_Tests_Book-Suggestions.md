# G1 Isotropic Restore Tests — Book Suggestions

These readings support lab teams who benchmark radially symmetric traps and verify equal stiffness along every axis.

## Core Mechanics
- *Introduction to Classical Mechanics* — David Morin. Provides vector-based treatments of harmonic potentials and isotropic oscillators.
- *Classical Mechanics: Point Particles and Relativity* — Walter Greiner. Covers small oscillations in multiple dimensions with clear derivations.

## Experimental Techniques
- *Atomic Physics* — Christopher J. Foot. Describes isotropic magneto-optical traps and diagnostic methods for restoring forces.
- *Optical Tweezers: Principles and Applications* — Philip H. Jones et al. Presents calibration routines for isotropic optical traps and Brownian checks.

## Data Analysis & Noise
- *Statistical Data Analysis* — Glen Cowan. Offers tools for variance estimation and hypothesis tests when comparing stiffness across axes.
- *Thermal Physics* — Charles Kittel & Herbert Kroemer. Connects equipartition predictions to measurable fluctuations in radially symmetric wells.
