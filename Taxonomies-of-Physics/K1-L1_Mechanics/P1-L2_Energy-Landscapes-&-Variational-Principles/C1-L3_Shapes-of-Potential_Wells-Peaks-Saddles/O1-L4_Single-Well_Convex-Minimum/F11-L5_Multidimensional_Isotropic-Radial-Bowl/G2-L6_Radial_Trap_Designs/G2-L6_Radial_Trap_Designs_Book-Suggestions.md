# G2 Radial Trap Designs — Book Suggestions

Trap builders need resources that bridge harmonic approximations with hardware layouts. These books walk through isotropic confinement strategies across physics subfields.

## Foundations of Trapping
- *Principles of Laser Cooling and Trapping* — Harold J. Metcalf & Peter van der Straten. Explains how optical gradients create isotropic restoring forces and how to set power budgets.
- *Charged Particle Traps* — Fouad G. Major et al. Details Penning and Paul trap design, including harmonic approximations and voltage tuning.

## Mechanical and Magnetic Wells
- *Magnetic Traps for Neutral Atoms* — Andrea G. Truscott & Nicola R. Heckenberg. Discusses coil geometries that deliver uniform gradients.
- *Magnetic Bearings: Theory, Design, and Application* — Gerhard Schweitzer & Eric H. Maslen. Offers engineering examples of radial stiffness planning in symmetric wells.

## Simulation & Optimization
- *Numerical Methods for Engineers* — Steven C. Chapra & Raymond P. Canale. Provides techniques for solving Laplace equations and optimizing symmetric fields.
- *Optimization Concepts and Applications in Engineering* — Ashok D. Belegundu & Tirupathi R. Chandrupatla. Covers constraint-driven design of isotropic traps.
