# G2 Directional Stiffness Tuning — Book Suggestions

Fine-tuning anisotropic wells blends structural optimization, compliant mechanisms, and control. These books provide targeted guidance.

## Structural Tuning
- *Mechanical Design of Machine Elements and Machines* — Jack A. Collins et al. Covers series and parallel stiffness adjustments in mechanical assemblies.
- *Compliant Mechanisms* — Larry L. Howell. Explains how to engineer flexures that tailor stiffness independently along different axes.

## Active Control Enhancements
- *Modern Control Engineering* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Presents gain design strategies that translate into effective stiffness changes in feedback systems.
- *Control System Design* — Graham C. Goodwin et al. Offers optimization techniques for multi-axis servo loops with anisotropic requirements.

## Optimization & Sensitivity
- *Engineering Optimization: Theory and Practice* — Singiresu S. Rao. Provides methods for sensitivity analysis when adjusting stiffness parameters to meet specs.
- *Sensitivity Analysis in Engineering: Techniques and Applications* — Trevor A. Mudge & Roger J. Wasilewski. Focuses on how small design tweaks shift stiffness outcomes.
