# G1-L6_Principal_Axis_Diagnostics — Genus Index
**Definition:** Teams map the easy and stiff directions of a valley-shaped energy floor.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Skatepark_Bowl_Line_Mapping** — Skatepark crews ride test lines to feel faster flow along the valley versus cross-slope.
- **S2-L7_Logistics_Sorter_Chute_Tuning** — Parcel centers adjust chute angles so boxes settle along the preferred slide path.
