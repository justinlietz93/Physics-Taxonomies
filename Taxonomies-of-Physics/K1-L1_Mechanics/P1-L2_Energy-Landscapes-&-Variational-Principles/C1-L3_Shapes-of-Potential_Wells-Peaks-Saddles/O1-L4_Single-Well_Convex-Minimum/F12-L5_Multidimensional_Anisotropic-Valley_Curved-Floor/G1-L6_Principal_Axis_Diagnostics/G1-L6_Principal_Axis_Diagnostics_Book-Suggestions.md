# G1 Principal Axis Diagnostics — Book Suggestions

Understanding anisotropic wells requires linear algebra, modal testing, and statistical fitting. These books equip readers with those tools.

## Mathematical Foundations
- *Linear Algebra Done Right* — Sheldon Axler. Builds intuition for eigenvectors and orthogonal diagonalization used in principal-axis extraction.
- *Matrix Analysis* — Roger A. Horn & Charles R. Johnson. Provides the rigorous background for symmetric matrices and perturbations.

## Experimental Modal Analysis
- *Experimental Modal Analysis* — Ewins D.J. Walks through impact testing, frequency response functions, and mode shape validation for anisotropic structures.
- *Modal Testing: Theory, Practice and Application* — He J. & Fu Z.-F. Bridges laboratory measurements with model-based identification of principal stiffness directions.

## Data Processing & Uncertainty
- *Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Philip R. Bevington & D. Keith Robinson. Guides fitting stiffness matrices from noisy force–displacement data.
- *Least Squares Data Fitting with Applications* — Per Christian Hansen et al. Explores algorithms for recovering symmetric parameters with confidence bounds.
