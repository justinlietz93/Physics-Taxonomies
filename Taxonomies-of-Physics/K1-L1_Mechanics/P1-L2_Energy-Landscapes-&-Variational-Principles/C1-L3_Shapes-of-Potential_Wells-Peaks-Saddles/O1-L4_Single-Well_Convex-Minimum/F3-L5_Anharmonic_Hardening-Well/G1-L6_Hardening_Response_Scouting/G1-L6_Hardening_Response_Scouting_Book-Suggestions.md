# G1 Hardening Response Scouting — Book Suggestions

These references help teams measure and interpret stiffening wells where resonance bends upward with amplitude.

## Nonlinear Vibrations
- *Nonlinear Vibrations* — David W. Jordan & Peter Smith. Introduces Duffing hardening behavior and frequency–amplitude curves.
- *Vibration Problems in Engineering* — S. Timoshenko et al. Discusses practical stiffening effects in beams and rotating shafts.

## Experimental Methods
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Provides laboratory techniques for swept-sine testing and backbone curve identification.
- *Random Data: Analysis and Measurement Procedures* — Julius S. Bendat & Allan G. Piersol. Offers spectral tools to detect stiffening through harmonic generation.

## Applications
- *Nonlinear Structural Dynamics Using FE Methods* — James F. Doyle. Applies hardening models to aerospace and civil components.
- *Dynamics of Marine Structures* — John M. Thompson & T. Stewart. Covers stiffening in mooring lines and risers under large loads.
