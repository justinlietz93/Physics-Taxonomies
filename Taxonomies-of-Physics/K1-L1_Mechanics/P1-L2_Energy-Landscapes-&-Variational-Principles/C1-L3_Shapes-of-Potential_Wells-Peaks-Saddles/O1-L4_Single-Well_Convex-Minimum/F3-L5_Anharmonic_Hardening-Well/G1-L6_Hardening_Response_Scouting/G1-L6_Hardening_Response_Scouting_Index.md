# G1-L6_Hardening_Response_Scouting — Genus Index
**Definition:** As motion grows the restoring force stiffens, so crews watch for quicker oscillations and rising loads.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Trampoline_Edge_Stiffness_Survey** — Gym staff hop near trampoline edges to confirm the tighter rebound away from center.
- **S2-L7_Gymnastics_Beam_Bounce_Test** — Coaches tap the balance beam to check how stiff response grows with deeper flex.
