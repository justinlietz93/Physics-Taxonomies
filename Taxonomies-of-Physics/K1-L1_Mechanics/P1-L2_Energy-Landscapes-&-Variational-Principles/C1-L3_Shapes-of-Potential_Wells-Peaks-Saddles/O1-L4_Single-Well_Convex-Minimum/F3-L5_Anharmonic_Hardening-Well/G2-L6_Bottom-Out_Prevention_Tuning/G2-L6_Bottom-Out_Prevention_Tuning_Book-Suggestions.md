# G2 Bottom-Out Prevention Tuning — Book Suggestions

Preventing hard contact demands knowledge of limit stops, damping, and safety margins. These books blend theory with design practices.

## Mechanical Design Safeguards
- *Mechanical Engineering Design* — J.E. Shigley & Charles R. Mischke. Offers design guidelines for stops, safety factors, and allowable stresses.
- *Machine Design: An Integrated Approach* — Robert L. Norton. Discusses travel limits and energy absorption features in machinery.

## Vibration Control
- *Passive Vibration Isolation* — Eugene I. Rivin. Covers hardening isolators and strategies for keeping motion within clearances.
- *Vibration Control Systems* — D. J. Inman. Explains damping selection and control tactics that prevent overshoot into stops.

## Reliability & Safety Margins
- *Engineering Design Reliability Applications* — N. Balakrishnan et al. Focuses on probabilistic safety factors for mechanical components.
- *Safety Factors: A Guide to their Use in Design* — A. Thoft-Christensen & M.J. Baker. Provides frameworks for evaluating how much margin is needed to avoid bottom-out events.
