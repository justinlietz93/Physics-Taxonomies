# G3 Small-Angle Pendulum as Harmonic — Book Suggestions

These titles help educators and metrology teams translate the linearized pendulum model into classroom labs and timing devices.

## Conceptual and Classroom Guides
- *The Pendulum: A Case Study in Physics* — Gregory L. Baker & James A. Blackburn. Explores the small-angle approximation with historical experiments and data sets students can replicate.
- *Physics by Inquiry, Volume I* — Lillian C. McDermott et al. Provides guided-inquiry activities that lead learners from qualitative pendulum observations to quantitative linear fits.

## Experimental Methods and Data Handling
- *Building Scientific Apparatus* — John H. Moore, Christopher C. Davis & Michael A. Coplan. Offers construction tips for low-friction pivots, optical timing, and data acquisition for pendulum rigs.
- *Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Philip R. Bevington & D. Keith Robinson. Step-by-step treatment of uncertainty propagation for period measurements and gravity estimates.

## Precision Timekeeping Applications
- *Precision Pendulum Clocks: The Quest for Accurate Timekeeping* — Marvin E. Whitney. Details design refinements—temperature compensation, suspension springs—that keep the motion within the harmonic regime.
- *The Marine Chronometer: Its History and Development* — Rupert T. Gould. Connects laboratory pendulum theory to field-ready chronometers and calibration practices.
