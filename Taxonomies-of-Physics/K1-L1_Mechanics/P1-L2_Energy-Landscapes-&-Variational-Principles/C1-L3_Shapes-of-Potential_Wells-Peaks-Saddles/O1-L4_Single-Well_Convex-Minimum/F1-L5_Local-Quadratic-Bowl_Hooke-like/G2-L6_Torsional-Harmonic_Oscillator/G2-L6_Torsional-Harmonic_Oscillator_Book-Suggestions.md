- *Analytical Mechanics* — Grant R. Fowles & George L. Cassiday. Bridges Lagrangian treatments of rotational oscillators to bench-top torsion pendulums.

## Design and Commissioning Manuals
- *Rotor Dynamics* — J.S. Rao. Details sizing torsion shafts, couplers, and flywheels with worked torsional eigenvalue studies.
- *Design of Machinery* — Robert L. Norton. Provides torsional spring design charts and cam-follower timing strategies aligned with angular oscillator projects.

## Diagnostics and Troubleshooting
- *Rotating Machinery Vibration: From Analysis to Troubleshooting* — Maurice L. Adams. Applies torsional response measurements to machinery health cases.
- *Handbook of Rotordynamics* — D.W. Childs. Deep dives on balancing, torsional resonance testing, and corrective actions in industrial drivetrains.
