# G2 Torsional-Harmonic Oscillator — Core Equations

Dial gauges on torsion bars and pendulum clocks share the same angular spring physics. These expressions let technicians map twist to torque, predict timing, and monitor energy in rotational oscillators.

## Angular Hooke's Law
**Restoring torque versus twist:**

$$
\tau = -k_{\theta} \, \theta
$$

- The torsional stiffness $k_{\theta}$ (N·m/rad) links measured angular deflection $\theta$ (rad) to the counteracting torque $\tau$, helping crews size shafts and dial test benches.

## Natural Frequency of Torsional Motion
**Characterising clockwork timing:**

$$
\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k_{\theta}}{I}}, \qquad T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_n}
$$

- With polar moment of inertia $I$ (kg·m$^2$) and stiffness $k_{\theta}$, teams compute the angular frequency $\omega_n$ and period $T$ to set metronome beats or avoid gearbox resonance.

## Energy Exchange in Angular Oscillators
**Tracking elastic twist and spin energy:**

$$
E(t) = \tfrac{1}{2} k_{\theta} \, \theta(t)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} I \, \omega(t)^2
$$

- Comparing stored twist energy and rotational kinetic energy highlights damping, lubrication issues, or loose couplings during calibration runs.
