# G4 Vertical Spring Shifted Equilibrium â€” Core Equations

A hanging spring shifts its resting point under gravity, yet small oscillations stay harmonic. These relations show how to reframe demonstrations around the new baseline instead of the unloaded length.

## Static Sag from Gravity
**Sets the new reference point before motion begins.**

$$\Delta z_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{mg}{k}$$

- The equilibrium sag $\Delta z_{\mathrm{eq}}$ balances weight $mg$ with the spring force $k\Delta z$, highlighting why heavier masses hang lower before any oscillation.

## Shifted Coordinate of Motion
**Shows that dynamics about the sagged point remain harmonic.**

$$\ddot{y} + \omega_0^2 y = 0, \qquad \omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$

- Writing displacement as $y = z - \Delta z_{\mathrm{eq}}$ removes the constant gravity term, so presenters can emphasize that frequency depends only on $k$ and $m$, not the static offset.

## Total Energy about the New Baseline
**Keeps bookkeeping clear when comparing to horizontal springs.**

$$E = \tfrac{1}{2}k y^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m \dot{y}^2 + E_{\mathrm{offset}}$$

- The offset energy $E_{\mathrm{offset}} = \tfrac{1}{2}k\Delta z_{\mathrm{eq}}^2 - mg\Delta z_{\mathrm{eq}}$ is constant, so only the quadratic terms in $y$ and $\dot{y}$ matter for oscillation amplitude and timing.

## Peak-to-Peak Amplitude with Offset
**Relates initial release height to motion around equilibrium.**

$$A = |z_{\mathrm{release}} - \Delta z_{\mathrm{eq}}|$$

- Measuring amplitude $A$ from the sagged point simplifies lab tracking: any additional drop maps directly to swing size without recalculating the weight-induced shift.
