# G4 Vertical Spring Shifted Equilibrium — Book Suggestions

These resources help communicators explain why hanging springs behave like their horizontal cousins once gravity's preload is accounted for.

## Introductory Treatments
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Walks through vertical mass–spring motion with clear energy diagrams that highlight the gravity offset before small oscillations.
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Provides problem sets comparing horizontal and vertical harmonic oscillators, perfect for illustrating the coordinate shift.

## Laboratory & Demonstration Guides
- *Physics Demonstrations: A Sourcebook for Teachers of Physics* — Julien C. Sprott. Includes vertical spring setups with tips on marking the sagged equilibrium for classroom clarity.
- *Teaching Introductory Physics* — Arnold Arons. Offers discussion prompts and measurement tricks for helping students reconcile static sag with oscillation frequency.

## Engineering Perspectives
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Frames vertical oscillators within vibration isolation and suspension design, showing how preload alters ride height but not natural frequency.
- *Dynamics of Mechanical Systems* — Harold Josephs & Ronald Huston. Covers linearization around biased equilibria, supporting advanced outreach that connects lab rigs to real machinery.
