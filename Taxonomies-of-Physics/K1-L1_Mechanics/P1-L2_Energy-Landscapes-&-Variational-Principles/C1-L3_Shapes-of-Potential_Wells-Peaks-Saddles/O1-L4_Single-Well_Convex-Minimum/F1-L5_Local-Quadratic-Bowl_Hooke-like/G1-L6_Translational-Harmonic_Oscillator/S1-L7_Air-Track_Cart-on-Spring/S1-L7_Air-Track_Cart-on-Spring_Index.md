# S1-L7_Air-Track_Cart-on-Spring — Species Index
**Definition:** A gliding cart attached to a coil spring oscillates with negligible friction, making Hooke’s law visible.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Picture: cart glides on air cushion; spring stretch sets restoring force.
- Watch energy swap between kinetic glide and spring compression; period set by \(\sqrt{m/k}\).
- Discuss deviations: residual friction or big stretches breaking the linear assumption.
