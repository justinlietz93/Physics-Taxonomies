# G1-L6_Translational-Harmonic_Oscillator — Genus Index
**Definition:** A mass sliding along one axis in a quadratic well; displacement and restoring force stay proportional.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Air-Track_Cart-on-Spring** — nearly frictionless demo where glide and bounce show ideal Hooke motion.
- **S2-L7_Car-Suspension_Small-Bump_Quarter-Car** — single-wheel model where springs/dampers smooth road ripples.
- **S3-L7_Drawer-Slider_Bounce_Stop** — drawer hits the end stop, compresses a damper, and settles without slam.
- **S4-L7_Seismograph_Mass-on-Spring_Frame-Motion** — suspended mass records ground motion by relative oscillation.
- **S5-L7_Tabletop_Mass-on-Coil-Spring_Low-Friction** — lab puck on springs illustrating energy swaps.
- **S6-L7_Vehicle_Hood_Shake_Test_Ringdown** — hood vibrates after a tap, revealing stiffness and damping.
- **S7-L7_CNC-Axis_Servo_Settling_Small-Step** — precision stage responds to a step, overshoots, then damps out.
- **S8-L7_Speaker-Cone_Suspension_Small-Excursion** — audio driver cone moves like a spring-mass for quiet notes.
