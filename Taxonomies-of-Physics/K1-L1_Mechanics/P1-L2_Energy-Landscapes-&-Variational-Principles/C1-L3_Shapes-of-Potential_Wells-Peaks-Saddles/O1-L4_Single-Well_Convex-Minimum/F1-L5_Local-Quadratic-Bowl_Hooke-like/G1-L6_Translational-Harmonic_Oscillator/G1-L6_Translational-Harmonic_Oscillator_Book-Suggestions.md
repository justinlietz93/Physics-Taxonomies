# G1 Translational-Harmonic Oscillator — Book Suggestions

These references help lab teams translate simple mass–spring theory into calibrated test rigs and predictive models for linear oscillators.

## Introductory Refreshers
- *An Introduction to Mechanics* — Kleppner & Kolenkow. Clear treatment of Hooke-like forces, energy storage, and small oscillations for students calibrating carts and springs.
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Builds intuition for sinusoidal motion, phase, and superposition that underpins shaker-table demonstrations.

## Experimental Playbooks
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — S.S. Rao. Practical guidance on identifying stiffness and damping from displacement data with worked examples for single-degree systems.
- *Experimental Vibrations: Methods and Instrumentation* — J.S. Bendat. Step-by-step instructions for sensor placement, excitation, and data reduction in lab oscillators.

## Maintenance and Diagnostics
- *Practical Machinery Vibration Analysis and Predictive Maintenance* — C. Scheffer & P. Girdhar. Connects energy-tracking equations to condition monitoring of reciprocating machinery.
- *Condition Monitoring with Vibration Signals* — A. Davies. Explains trend analysis, spectral alarms, and balancing checks aligned with translational oscillator health tracking.
