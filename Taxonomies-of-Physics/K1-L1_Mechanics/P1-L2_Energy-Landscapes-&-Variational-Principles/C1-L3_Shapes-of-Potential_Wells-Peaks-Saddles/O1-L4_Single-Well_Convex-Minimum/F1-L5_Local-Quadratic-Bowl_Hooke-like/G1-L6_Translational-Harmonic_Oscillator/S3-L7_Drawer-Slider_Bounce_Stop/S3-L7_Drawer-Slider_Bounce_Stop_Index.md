# S3-L7_Drawer-Slider_Bounce_Stop — Species Index
**Definition:** A kitchen drawer hits its soft-close mechanism, compresses a spring-damper, and settles without slamming.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Motion converts to spring compression; damper bleeds energy so the drawer rests gently.
- The “catch” sets initial conditions; spring stiffness sets how far it rebounds before stopping.
- Relate to design trade-offs: too little damping and it slams; too much and it feels sluggish.
