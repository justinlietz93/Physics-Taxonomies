# S2-L7_Car-Suspension_Small-Bump_Quarter-Car — Species Index
**Definition:** A single-wheel suspension responds to a road ripple, showing how springs and dampers smooth passenger motion.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Show road bump input vs chassis response; spring stores energy, damper bleeds it away.
- Discuss tuning: soft springs give comfort but allow sway; damping prevents bounce-back.
- Extend to active suspensions that sense and counteract bumps in real time.
