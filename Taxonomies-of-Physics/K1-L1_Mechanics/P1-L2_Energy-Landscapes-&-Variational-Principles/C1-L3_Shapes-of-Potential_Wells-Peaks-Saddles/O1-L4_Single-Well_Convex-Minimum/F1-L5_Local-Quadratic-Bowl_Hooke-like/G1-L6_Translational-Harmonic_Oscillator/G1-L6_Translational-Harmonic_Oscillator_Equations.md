# G1 Translational-Harmonic Oscillator — Core Equations

Lab carts on springs and shaker-table fixtures follow predictable mass–spring patterns. These relationships let technicians set stiffness, track stored energy, and schedule maintenance on linear oscillators.

## Hooke's Law Force Balance
**Restoring force from displacement:**

$$
F = -k x
$$

- The spring constant $k$ (N/m) converts measured displacement $x$ (m) into force, with the negative sign showing the pull back toward equilibrium.

## Natural Frequency and Period
**Timing the undamped motion:**

$$
\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \qquad T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_n}
$$

- With known mass $m$ (kg) and stiffness $k$, crews calculate the angular natural frequency $\omega_n$ (rad/s) and period $T$ (s) to match sampling rates or avoid resonance.

## Energy Ledger of the Oscillator
**Splitting between kinetic and potential stores:**

$$
E(t) = \tfrac{1}{2} k x(t)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m v(t)^2
$$

- The sum of elastic and kinetic energy tracks ideal oscillators; deviations flag damping, rubbing, or misalignment during acceptance testing.
