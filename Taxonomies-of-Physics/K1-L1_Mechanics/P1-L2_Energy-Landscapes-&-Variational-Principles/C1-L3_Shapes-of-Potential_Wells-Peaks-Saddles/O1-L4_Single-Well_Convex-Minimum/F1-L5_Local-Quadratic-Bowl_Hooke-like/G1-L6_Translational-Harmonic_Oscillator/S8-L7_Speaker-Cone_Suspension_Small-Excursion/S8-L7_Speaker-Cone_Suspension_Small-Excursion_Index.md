# S8-L7_Speaker-Cone_Suspension_Small-Excursion — Species Index
**Definition:** A loudspeaker cone vibrates within its linear suspension range, acting like a mass-spring-damper tuned for sound.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Voice coil current pushes cone; spider and surround supply restoring force like springs.
- At small excursions response is linear; near resonance amplitude peaks unless damping (air + suspension) tames it.
- Connect to hi-fi tuning: designers pick mass, compliance, and damping to hit target bass response.
