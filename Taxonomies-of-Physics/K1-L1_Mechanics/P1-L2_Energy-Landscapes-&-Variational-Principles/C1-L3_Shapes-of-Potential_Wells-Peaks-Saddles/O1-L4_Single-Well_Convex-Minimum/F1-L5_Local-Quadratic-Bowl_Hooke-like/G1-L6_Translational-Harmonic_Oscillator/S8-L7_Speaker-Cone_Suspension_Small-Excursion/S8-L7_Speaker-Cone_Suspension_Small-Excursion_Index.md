# S8-L7_Speaker-Cone_Suspension_Small-Excursion — Species Index

**Definition:** Speaker cone suspended by compliant surround/spider; small excursion ≈ harmonic about rest.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes (plain words)
- Picture: what moves, what restores, what resists.
- What would double the tempo? What damps it?
- Boundaries/assumptions: small displacement, near equilibrium.
