# G5 Multi-DOF Decoupled Harmonics (Orthogonal Axes) — Book Suggestions

These selections support storytellers who need to explain multi-axis oscillators without drowning audiences in matrix algebra.

## Multiaxis Modeling Primers
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Grant R. Fowles & George L. Cassiday. Introduces normal modes and separable coordinates with accessible worked examples.
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Offers matrix-based derivations followed by clear physical interpretations for orthogonal springs.

## Engineering & Instrumentation References
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Rao. Details modal testing and decoupling procedures used in aerospace shakers and precision platforms.
- *Vibration Simulation Using MATLAB and ANSYS* — Michael R. Hatch. Provides practical walkthroughs for verifying independent modes in finite element models.

## Visualization & Outreach Resources
- *The Art of Lissajous Figures* — Nathaniel Babcock. Presents historical demonstrations and visualizations that turn orthogonal oscillations into engaging displays.
- *Make: Rockets* — Mike Westerfield. Includes payload isolation projects that rely on orthogonal spring stacks, giving hobbyists relatable case studies.
