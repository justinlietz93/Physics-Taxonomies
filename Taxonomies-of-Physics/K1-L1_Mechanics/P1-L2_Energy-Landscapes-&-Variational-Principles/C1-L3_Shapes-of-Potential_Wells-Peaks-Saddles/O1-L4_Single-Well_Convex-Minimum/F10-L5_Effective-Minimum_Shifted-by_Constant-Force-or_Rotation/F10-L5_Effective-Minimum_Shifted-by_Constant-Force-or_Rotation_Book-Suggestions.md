# F10 Effective Minimum Shifted by Constant Force or Rotation — Book Suggestions

These books highlight gravitational sag, bias forces, and rotating-frame effects that shift equilibrium positions while preserving single-well dynamics.

## Mechanics and Rotating Frames
- *Classical Mechanics: Point Particles and Relativity* — Walter Greiner. Provides detailed treatments of fictitious forces and effective potentials in rotating frames.
- *Mechanics* — L. D. Landau & E. M. Lifshitz. Derives centrifugal and Coriolis corrections to harmonic potentials and their impact on small oscillations.

## Precision Instrumentation
- *Foundations of Mechanics of Materials* — Clifford A. Truesdell & Walter Noll. Explains how constant biases alter equilibrium in elastic systems, relevant to precision balances.
- *Gravitation and Inertia* — Ignazio Ciufolini & John A. Wheeler. Discusses gravitational sag compensation and effective potentials in rotating reference frames for gyroscopes.

## Engineering Applications
- *Rotordynamics* — Rajendra Kumar Bera. Addresses stiffness reduction under spin and strategies for maintaining stability in rotating machinery.
- *Precision Engineering* — Herman T. Van Pham & Alexander H. Slocum. Covers compensation techniques for constant-force offsets in high-accuracy mechanical assemblies.
