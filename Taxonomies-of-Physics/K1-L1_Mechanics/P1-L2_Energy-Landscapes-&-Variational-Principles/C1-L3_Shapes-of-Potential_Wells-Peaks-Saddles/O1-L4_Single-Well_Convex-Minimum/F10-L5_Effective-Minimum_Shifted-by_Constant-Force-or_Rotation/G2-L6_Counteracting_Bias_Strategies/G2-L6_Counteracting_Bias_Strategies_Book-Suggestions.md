# G2 Counteracting Bias Strategies — Book Suggestions

Calibration crews need references on preload design, feedback trim, and mechanical shimming to cancel unwanted offsets. These titles mix lab pragmatism with analysis.

## Mechanical Compensation
- *Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics* — J.L. Meriam & L.G. Kraige. Offers examples of balancing torques and counterweights in rotating systems.
- *Mechanical Springs* — A.M. Wahl. Details preload adjustments, shim choices, and constant-force spring tricks for bias cancellation.

## Controls & Instrumentation
- *Feedback Systems* — Karl J. Åström & Richard M. Murray. Introduces steady-state error analysis and bias rejection with proportional-integral controllers.
- *Measurement Systems: Application and Design* — Ernest O. Doebelin & Dhanesh N. Manik. Provides practical strategies for nulling offsets in sensors and actuators.

## Precision Alignment Case Studies
- *Precision Machine Design* — Alexander H. Slocum. Discusses flexure tuning, counterforce placement, and error budgeting in precision assemblies.
- *Vibration Damping, Control, and Design* — Clarence W. de Silva. Covers active and passive methods to remove steady loads while preserving dynamic response.
