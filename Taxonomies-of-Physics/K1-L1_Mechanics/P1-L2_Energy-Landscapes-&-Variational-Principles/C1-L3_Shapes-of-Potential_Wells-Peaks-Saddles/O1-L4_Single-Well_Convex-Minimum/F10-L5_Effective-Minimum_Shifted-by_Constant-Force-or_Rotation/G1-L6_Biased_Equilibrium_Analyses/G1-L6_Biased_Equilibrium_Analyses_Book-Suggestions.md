# G1 Biased Equilibrium Analyses — Book Suggestions

These resources help readers visualize how constant fields or rotations tip a quadratic well, translating calculus into hands-on calibration stories.

## Conceptual Foundations
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Chapters on driven oscillators highlight how constant forces shift equilibrium while preserving curvature.
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Grant R. Fowles & George L. Cassiday. Provides concise treatments of effective potentials and generalized forces.

## Engineering & Metrology
- *Mechanical Measurements* — Thomas G. Beckwith et al. Details sensor bias calibration, offering case studies for restoring neutral baselines.
- *System Dynamics* — William J. Palm III. Explains equilibrium offsets in control loops and how to tune damping for biased configurations.

## Advanced & Rotating Frames
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Derives rotating frame potentials and centrifugal shifts relevant to tilted wells.
- *Nonlinear Oscillations* — Ali H. Nayfeh & Dean T. Mook. Explores how constant loads modify limit positions in weakly nonlinear systems.
