# G1 Biased Equilibrium Analyses â€” Core Equations

Constant torques or uniform fields tip a quadratic well so the lowest point migrates. These relations help presenters quantify how the biased minimum sits and how stiff it still feels.

## Shifted Stationary Point
**Solves for the new resting position once a constant bias acts.**

$$x_{\mathrm{eq}} = x_0 + \frac{F_{\mathrm{bias}}}{k}$$

- The rest coordinate shifts by the ratio of the constant force $F_{\mathrm{bias}}$ to stiffness $k$, letting demos emphasize how a gentle nudge only re-centers the oscillation rather than changing curvature.

## Effective Potential with Linear Tilt
**Rewrites the energy landscape so the bias appears explicitly.**

$$V_{\mathrm{eff}}(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}k(x-x_0)^2 - F_{\mathrm{bias}}(x-x_0)$$

- Subtracting the work done by the constant force yields a parabola whose axis is displaced, making it easy to sketch how the bowl leans without changing its opening.

## Residual Barrier to Return
**Estimates the energy needed to climb back to the unbiased origin.**

$$\Delta V = \tfrac{1}{2}\frac{F_{\mathrm{bias}}^2}{k}$$

- The square dependence on $F_{\mathrm{bias}}$ shows that doubling the bias quadruples the energy drop, helping storytellers compare mild vs. aggressive tilts.

## Relaxation Time in a Biased Well
**Shows that damping governs how quickly the system settles into the shifted point.**

$$\tau = \frac{\gamma}{k}$$

- The same ratio of viscous coefficient $\gamma$ to stiffness $k$ controls the exponential approach, reinforcing that a static bias moves the goalpost but does not change the time constant.
