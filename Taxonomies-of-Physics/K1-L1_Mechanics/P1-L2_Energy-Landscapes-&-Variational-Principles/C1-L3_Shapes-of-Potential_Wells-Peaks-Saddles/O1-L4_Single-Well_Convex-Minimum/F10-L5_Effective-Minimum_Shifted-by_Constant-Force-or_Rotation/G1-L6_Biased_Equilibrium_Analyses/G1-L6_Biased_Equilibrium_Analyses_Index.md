# G1-L6_Biased_Equilibrium_Analyses — Genus Index
**Definition:** Evaluate how constant pushes shift the rest point so controls can compensate.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Pendulum_in_Accelerating_Elevator_Demo** — Science centers ride a pendulum elevator to show the bob tilting with upward acceleration.
- **S2-L7_Robot_On_Slope_Force_Balance_Check** — Warehouse robots park on ramps to adjust motor torque for the shifted weight balance.
