# G1 Ringdown Health Monitoring — Book Suggestions

These titles help maintenance teams translate decaying waveforms into health assessments, blending vibration basics with field-ready diagnostics.

## Vibration Signatures & Damping Fundamentals
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Explains underdamped responses, logarithmic decrement, and frequency tracking that underpin ringdown interpretation.
- *Theory of Vibration with Applications* — Thomson & Dahleh. Links modal parameters to measurable decay curves with case studies on rotating machinery.

## Condition Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance
- *Condition Monitoring with Vibration Signals* — M. A. Serrano. Focuses on data collection, envelope analysis, and fault thresholds directly applicable to ringdown health checks.
- *Practical Machinery Vibration Analysis and Predictive Maintenance* — Cornelius Scheffer. Provides hands-on workflows for capturing transient responses and trending quality factors over time.

## Sensors and Data Processing
- *Vibration-Based Condition Monitoring* — Robert Bond Randall. Covers sensor placement, signal conditioning, and Hilbert-transform techniques for instantaneous frequency tracking during decay tests.
