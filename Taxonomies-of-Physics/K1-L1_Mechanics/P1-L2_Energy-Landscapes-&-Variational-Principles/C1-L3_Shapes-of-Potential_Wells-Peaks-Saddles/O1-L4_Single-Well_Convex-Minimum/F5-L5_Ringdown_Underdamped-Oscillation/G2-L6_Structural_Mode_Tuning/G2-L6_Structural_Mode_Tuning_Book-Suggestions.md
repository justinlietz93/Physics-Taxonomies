# G2 Structural Mode Tuning — Book Suggestions

These resources connect structural dynamics theory with practical recipes for nudging modal frequencies, damping, and shapes into specification.

## Modal Analysis & Structural Dynamics
- *Fundamentals of Structural Dynamics* — Roy R. Craig & Andrew J. Kurdila. Sets up mode shapes, Rayleigh quotients, and sensitivity tools crucial for tuning campaigns.
- *Modal Testing: Theory, Practice, and Application* — D. J. Ewins. Details experimental workflows for extracting modes and validating tuning adjustments with MAC metrics.

## Tuned Mass Dampers & Vibration Control
- *Structural Control for Civil and Infrastructure Engineering* — A. T. Soong & B. F. Spencer. Surveys tuned-mass and fluid dampers with design charts that translate directly into $\mu$, $f$, and $\zeta_{\text{eff}}$ decisions.
- *Tuned Mass Dampers* — Daniela Vulcu & Silviu-Constantin Caprarescu. Focuses on optimization and case studies for skyscrapers, bridges, and machine tools needing precise mode placement.

## Optimization & Sensitivity Methods
- *Topology Optimization in Structural Mechanics* — George Rozvany. Provides material redistribution strategies that complement mode-tuning intuition when stiffness changes must stay lightweight.
- *Structural Optimization* — William F. Baker. Covers mathematical foundations and practical algorithms for sensitivity analysis and optimal design in engineering structures.
