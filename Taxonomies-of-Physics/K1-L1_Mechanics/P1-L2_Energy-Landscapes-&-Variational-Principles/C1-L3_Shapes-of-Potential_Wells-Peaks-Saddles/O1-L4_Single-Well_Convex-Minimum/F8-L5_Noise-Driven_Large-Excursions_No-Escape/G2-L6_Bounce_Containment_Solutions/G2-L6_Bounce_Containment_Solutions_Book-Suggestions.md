# G2 Bounce Containment Solutions — Book Suggestions

Containment planning draws on impact dynamics, damping materials, and active clamp design. These books provide relevant guidance.

## Impact & Cushioning
- *Impact Dynamics* — W.J. Stronge. Covers collision mechanics, restitution, and energy dissipation in bumpers.
- *Design of Elastomeric Components* — L.R. G. Treloar. Discusses material selection and stress limits for damping cushions.

## Active Control Measures
- *Mechatronics: Electronic Control Systems in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering* — W. Bolton. Highlights actuator integration and safety interlocks for clamp systems.
- *Active Control of Noise and Vibration* — Colin Hansen & Scott Snyder. Provides algorithms and hardware examples for active mitigation of excursions.

## Reliability & Testing
- *Testing of Materials and Structures* — A. H. Allen. Presents drop and impact test methodologies to verify containment solutions.
- *Practical Machinery Vibration Analysis and Predictive Maintenance* — Cornelius Scheffer & Paresh Girdhar. Offers case studies on preventing contact damage in rotating equipment.
