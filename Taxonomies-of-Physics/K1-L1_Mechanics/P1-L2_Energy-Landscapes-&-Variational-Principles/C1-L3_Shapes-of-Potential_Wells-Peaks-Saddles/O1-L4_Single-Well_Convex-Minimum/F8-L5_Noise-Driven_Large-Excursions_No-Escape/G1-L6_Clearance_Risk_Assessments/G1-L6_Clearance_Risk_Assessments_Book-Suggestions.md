# G1 Clearance Risk Assessments — Book Suggestions

Managing large excursions calls for expertise in random vibrations, reliability, and safety margins. These references cover those topics.

## Random Vibration Theory
- *Random Vibrations: Theory and Practice* — Paul H. Wirsching et al. Discusses probability of exceedance and spectral analysis for structural motion.
- *Random Data: Analysis and Measurement Procedures* — Julius S. Bendat & Allan G. Piersol. Provides tools for rms estimation and Gaussian exceedance calculations.

## Reliability & Safety
- *Structural Reliability Analysis and Prediction* — Robert E. Melchers. Presents probabilistic design methods for clearance-driven risks.
- *Engineering Safety: Fundamentals, Techniques, Applications* — Richard C. Fries. Focuses on hazard assessment and acceptable risk criteria.

## Noise Mitigation Strategies
- *Active Control of Noise and Vibration* — Colin Hansen & Scott Snyder. Offers solutions for reducing excitation that drives excursions.
- *Mechanical Shock and Vibration Analysis* — C.W. de Silva. Covers case studies on maintaining clearances under random disturbances.
