# O1 Single-Well Convex Minimum — Book Suggestions

Single-well potentials are the baseline that anchor the rest of the energy-landscape zoo. These references keep the focus on harmonic and gently anharmonic wells where curvature stays positive and motion remains confined.

## Harmonic Benchmarks
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein, Charles Poole, & John Safko. Derives small-oscillation theory and normal-mode reductions that treat any smooth convex minimum as a generalized spring.
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A. P. French. Builds physical intuition for single-degree systems oscillating in parabolic bowls, from pendulums to LC tanks.

## Anharmonic Refinements
- *Nonlinear Oscillations* — Ali H. Nayfeh & Dean T. Mook. Shows how softening and hardening corrections bend frequency–amplitude curves while the well stays single-valued.
- *Perturbation Methods* — Ali H. Nayfeh. Provides asymptotic tools for capturing higher-order curvature terms without losing stability.

## Thermal and Quantum Views
- *Statistical Mechanics* — R. K. Pathria & Paul D. Beale. Uses partition functions of quadratic wells to illustrate fluctuation scales and equipartition in convex basins.
- *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* — David J. Griffiths & Darrell F. Schroeter. Treats harmonic confinement as the solvable limit and outlines corrections when the well deviates slightly from parabolic.
