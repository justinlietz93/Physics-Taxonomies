# F6 Driven Steady Oscillation in a Well — Book Suggestions

These selections explain forced linear oscillations, phase control, and laboratory methods for mapping frequency response within single wells.

## Theory and Analysis
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Provides comprehensive derivations of forced response, phasor solutions, and power balance in damped oscillators.
- *Dynamics of Structures* — Anil K. Chopra. Discusses steady-state harmonic loading, resonance curves, and damping design for civil systems modeled as single wells.

## Measurement and Experimental Methods
- *Frequency Response Testing in Mechanical Engineering* — Arthur H. Nay. Details swept-sine, multi-tone, and steady-state measurement techniques for extracting amplitude and phase data.
- *Experimental Methods in Vibration Analysis* — James W. Dally & William F. Riley. Guides instrumentation setups for measuring forced response in lab-scale rigs.

## Control and Applications
- *Vibration Control of Active Structures* — André Preumont. Connects steady-state response shaping to active damping and feedback strategies.
- *Active and Passive Vibration Control of Structures* — A. V. Srinivasan & D. Michael McFarland. Surveys actuator technologies and control algorithms that exploit single-well forced oscillation models.
