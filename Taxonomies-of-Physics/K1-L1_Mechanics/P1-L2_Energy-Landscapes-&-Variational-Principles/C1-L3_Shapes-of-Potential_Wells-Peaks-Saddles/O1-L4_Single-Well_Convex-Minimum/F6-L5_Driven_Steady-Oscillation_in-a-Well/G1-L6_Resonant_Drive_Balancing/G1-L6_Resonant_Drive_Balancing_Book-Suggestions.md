# G1 Resonant Drive Balancing — Book Suggestions

These titles help facilitators explain why balancing and damping tweaks tame resonant peaks in spinning drums and shaker tables.

## Resonance Fundamentals
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Provides detailed forced-response derivations and design charts that show how damping and detuning re-shape resonance peaks.
- *Principles of Vibration* — Benson H. Tongue. Offers intuitive narratives and examples for identifying resonance conditions in rotating machinery and lab hardware.

## Balancing & Diagnostics
- *Rotordynamics* — Agnieszka Muszynska. Connects amplitude-phase measurements with balancing procedures for industrial rotors, reinforcing the need to track quality factors and phase lags.
- *Machinery Vibration and Rotordynamics* — John M. Vance, Fouad Y. Zeidan & Brian Killingsworth. Walks through field balancing, instrumentation, and troubleshooting techniques tuned to resonant operation.

## Outreach & Demonstrations
- *The Art of Doing Science and Engineering* — Richard Hamming. Shares storytelling strategies about resonance control that translate well for museum or classroom demos.
- *Physics Demo Manual* — Julien C. Sprott. Catalogs hands-on oscillation demonstrations that highlight balancing tricks to keep resonant displays smooth and safe.
