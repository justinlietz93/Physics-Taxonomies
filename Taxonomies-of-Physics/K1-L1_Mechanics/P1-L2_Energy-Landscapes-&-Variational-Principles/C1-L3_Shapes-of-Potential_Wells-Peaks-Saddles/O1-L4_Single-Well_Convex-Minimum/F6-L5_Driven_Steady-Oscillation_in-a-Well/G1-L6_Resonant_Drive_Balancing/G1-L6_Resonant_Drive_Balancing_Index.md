# G1-L6_Resonant_Drive_Balancing — Genus Index
**Definition:** Operators balance forced oscillations near resonance so the steady motion stays smooth.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Washing_Machine_Spin_Balance_Run** — Appliance techs redistribute laundry to stop tub resonance during spin.
- **S2-L7_Lab_Shaker_Amplitude_Setting** — Researchers dial orbital shaker amplitude so samples mix without walking off the plate.
