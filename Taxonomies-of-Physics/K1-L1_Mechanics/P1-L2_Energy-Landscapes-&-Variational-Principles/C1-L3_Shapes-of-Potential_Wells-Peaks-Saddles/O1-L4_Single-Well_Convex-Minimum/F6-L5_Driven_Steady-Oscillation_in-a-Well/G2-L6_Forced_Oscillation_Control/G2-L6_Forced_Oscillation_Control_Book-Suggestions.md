# G2 Forced Oscillation Control — Book Suggestions

These resources blend vibration theory with control tactics so teams can script engaging demonstrations of active suppression and amplitude targeting.

## Control Theory Foundations
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene F. Franklin, J. David Powell & Abbas Emami-Naeini. Sets up frequency-response tools and controller tuning strategies that map directly onto forced-oscillation balancing.
- *Modern Control Engineering* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Covers pole placement and state-feedback ideas that help explain how added damping gains reshape resonance peaks.

## Applied Vibration Control
- *Active Control of Vibration* — Christopher C. Fuller, Shen-Ye Li & Lawrence A. Rogers. Details sensor-actuator layouts, velocity feedback, and adaptive strategies for holding oscillators at safe amplitudes.
- *Structural Vibration: Analysis and Damping* — C. Beards. Links practical damper implementations with the equations of motion used in forced oscillation control workshops.

## Outreach & Laboratory Guides
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Provides approachable narratives and experiments illustrating drive-response phase relationships for classroom audiences.
- *Make: Sensors* — Tero Karvinen, Kimmo Karvinen & Ville Valtokari. Offers hands-on sensor integration ideas for DIY vibration-control demonstrations using accessible hardware.
