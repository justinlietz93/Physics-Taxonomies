# G1 Viscous Settling Audits — Book Suggestions

Teams performing overdamped relaxation tests benefit from texts on first-order systems, rheology, and metrology.

## Dynamics & Control Basics
- *System Dynamics* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Presents first-order models, settling-time formulas, and parameter identification techniques.
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene F. Franklin et al. Provides step-response metrics and practical guidelines for overdamped behavior.

## Rheology and Viscous Media
- *Viscoelasticity: Phenomenological Aspects* — Wilhelm Flügge. Explains how viscous coefficients arise from materials under slow deformation.
- *Introduction to Polymer Viscoelasticity* — Montgomery T. Shaw & William J. MacKnight. Connects relaxation data to material parameters for soft wells.

## Measurement & Data Reduction
- *Experimental Methods for Engineers* — J.P. Holman. Offers best practices for time-series measurement, uncertainty, and curve fitting.
- *Statistics for Experimenters* — George E. P. Box et al. Guides exponential fit evaluation and confidence intervals for settling curves.
