# O1-L4_Single-Well_Convex-Minimum — Order Index
**Definition:** A single stable basin with positive curvature everywhere; dynamics relax or oscillate about one equilibrium.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Local-Quadratic-Bowl_Hooke-like** — near-bottom behavior matches a harmonic spring.
- **F2-L5_Anharmonic_Softening-Well** — curvature weakens with amplitude; large swings slow down.
- **F3-L5_Anharmonic_Hardening-Well** — stiffness stiffens with amplitude; big motions speed up.
- **F4-L5_Damped-Relaxation_Overdamped** — viscous drag dominates, so motion creeps without overshoot.
- **F5-L5_Ringdown_Underdamped-Oscillation** — small damping lets oscillations persist while decaying.
- **F6-L5_Driven_Steady-Oscillation_in-a-Well** — periodic forcing balances losses to set a steady amplitude.
- **F7-L5_Thermal-Fluctuations_in-a-Well** — random kicks explore the bowl yet rarely escape.
- **F8-L5_Noise-Driven_Large-Excursions_No-Escape** — noise pushes far from center but walls confine.
- **F9-L5_Adiabatic-Parameter-Sweep_Tracking-the-Minimum** — slowly moving the well drags the state along.
- **F10-L5_Effective-Minimum_Shifted-by_Constant-Force-or_Rotation** — biases tilt the bowl and move equilibrium.
- **F11-L5_Multidimensional_Isotropic-Radial-Bowl** — same curvature in all directions; spherical stiffness.
- **F12-L5_Multidimensional_Anisotropic-Valley_Curved-Floor** — different curvatures along axes produce valleys and ridges.
