# O2 Double-Well Symmetric — Book Suggestions

Symmetric double wells highlight tunneling, switching, and pitchfork bifurcations. These references keep the symmetry explicit so the two minima share curvature and depth.

## Classical Dynamics
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven H. Strogatz. Uses symmetric double wells as the archetype for pitchfork bifurcations and separatrices.
- *Applied Nonlinear Dynamics* — Ali H. Nayfeh & Balakumar Balachandran. Details perturbative methods for symmetric wells under driving and damping.

## Quantum & Tunneling
- *Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications* — Nouredine Zettili. Provides analytic and numerical treatments of tunneling splitting in symmetric potentials.
- *Instantons and Large Order Behavior* — Jean Zinn-Justin. Explains semiclassical bounce solutions that connect the identical minima.

## Statistical & Field Views
- *Phase Transitions and Renormalization Group* — Jean Zinn-Justin. Shows how symmetric \(\phi^{4}\) potentials map onto double-well order parameters.
- *Critical Phenomena in Natural Sciences* — Didier Sornette. Applies double-well landscapes to switching phenomena across physics, chemistry, and finance.
