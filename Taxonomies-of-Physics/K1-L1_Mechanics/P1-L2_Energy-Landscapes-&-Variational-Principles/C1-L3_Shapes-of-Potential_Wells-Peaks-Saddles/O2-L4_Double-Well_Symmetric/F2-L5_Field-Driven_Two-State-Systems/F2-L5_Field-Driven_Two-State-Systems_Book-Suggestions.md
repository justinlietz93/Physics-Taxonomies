# F2 Field-Driven Two-State Systems — Book Suggestions

These books support teams translating symmetric double wells into two-state actuators, sensors, and memory elements.

## Physical Principles
- *Statistical Mechanics* — Pathria & Beale. Provides two-level system thermodynamics, partition functions, and field-coupling formalisms.
- *Thermal Physics* — Daniel Schroeder. Offers intuitive treatments of two-state ensembles and Boltzmann factors for design back-of-envelope checks.

## Device-Oriented References
- *Magnetic Recording: The First 100 Years* — Eric D. Daniel et al. Traces field-driven switching in magnetic media, including energy barrier tailoring and reliability.
- *Ferroelectric Memories* — J. F. Scott. Details electric-field control, switching kinetics, and fatigue in bistable ferroelectric cells.

## Measurement and Control
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — N. G. van Kampen. Supplies master equation formalisms and transition-rate models for driven two-state systems.
- *Noise in Nanoelectronic Devices* — Fabrizio Bonani & Matjaz P. Djuric. Discusses thermal activation, retention time statistics, and readout signal processing for two-state devices.
