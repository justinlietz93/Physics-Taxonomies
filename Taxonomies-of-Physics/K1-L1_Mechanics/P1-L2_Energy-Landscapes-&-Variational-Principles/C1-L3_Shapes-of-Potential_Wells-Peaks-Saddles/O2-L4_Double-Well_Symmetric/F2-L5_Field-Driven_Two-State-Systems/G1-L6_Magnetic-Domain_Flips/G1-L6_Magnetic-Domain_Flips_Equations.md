# G1 Magnetic Domain Flips — Core Equations

Magnetic domains exhibit bistability under opposing fields. These equations describe switching thresholds and dynamics.

## Zeeman Energy Difference
**Calculates energy bias from external field.**

$$\Delta E = -2 \mu_0 M_s H V$$

- The energy difference between aligned and anti-aligned domains scales with saturation magnetization $M_s$, field $H$, and volume $V$.

## Switching Field (Stoner-Wohlfarth Model)
**Determines the critical field for coherent rotation.**

$$H_c = \frac{2K}{\mu_0 M_s}$$

- Anisotropy constant $K$ sets the coercive field needed to flip the domain, guiding magnet design.

## Néel-Arrhenius Switching Time
**Estimates thermally activated flip time.**

$$\tau = \tau_0 e^{K V / k_B T}$$

- Larger volumes or anisotropy increase the exponential barrier, lengthening retention times.

## Hysteresis Loop Area
**Measures energy dissipated per cycle.**

$$E_{\mathrm{loop}} = \oint M dH$$

- Integrating magnetization over the field cycle quantifies heating and provides a direct comparison to mechanical bistability.
