# S2-L7_Breadboard_LED_Flip-Flop — Species Index
**Definition:** A hobby flip-flop kit alternates LEDs because cross-coupled transistors form two identical voltage wells.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Two transistors feed back on each other so only one conducts at a time; resistors set the barrier height.
- A clock or noise spike drives the circuit past the midpoint, turning one LED off while the other lights.
- Demonstrates how digital memory holds bits as symmetric energy wells separated by a saddle.
