# F1 Mechanical Bistable Switches — Book Suggestions

References here guide the design and analysis of bistable mechanical components and compliant mechanisms.

## Design Fundamentals
- *Compliant Mechanisms* — Larry L. Howell. Presents design rules, energy landscapes, and snap-through examples for bistable linkages.
- *Mechanics of Microelectromechanical Systems* — N. Lobontiu & E. Garcia. Details micro-scale bistable beams, actuation thresholds, and fabrication constraints.

## Analysis and Modeling
- *Nonlinear Oscillations, Dynamical Systems, and Bifurcations of Vector Fields* — Guckenheimer & Holmes. Covers Duffing dynamics, phase portraits, and bifurcation tools relevant to bistable switches.
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — S. S. Rao. Provides analytical and numerical methods for nonlinear oscillators with examples on snap-through and multi-stable systems.

## Applications and Case Studies
- *Bistable Mechanisms: Design and Applications* — Hai-Jun Su & R. S. P. King. Surveys macro- and micro-scale devices, including energy harvesting and deployable structures.
- *Adaptive Structures: Engineering Applications* — David Wagg et al. Highlights bistable elements in morphing structures, aerospace panels, and smart actuators.
