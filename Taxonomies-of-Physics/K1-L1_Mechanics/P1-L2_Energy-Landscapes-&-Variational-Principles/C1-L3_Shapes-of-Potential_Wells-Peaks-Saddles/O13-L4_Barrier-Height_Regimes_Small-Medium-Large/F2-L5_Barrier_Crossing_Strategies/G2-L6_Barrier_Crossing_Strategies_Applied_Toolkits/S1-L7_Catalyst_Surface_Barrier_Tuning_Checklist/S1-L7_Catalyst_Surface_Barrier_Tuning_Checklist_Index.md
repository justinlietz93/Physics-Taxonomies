# S1-L7_Catalyst_Surface_Barrier_Tuning_Checklist — Species Index
**Definition:** Collects quick checks for tweaking catalyst surfaces so adsorbed molecules cross the rate-limiting hurdle.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes

- Walk through surface cleaning, promoter dosing, and monitoring conversion pulses in a benchtop reactor.
- Note red flags like coke buildup or temperature drift that rebuild the barrier.
