# G2 Barrier Crossing Strategies Applied Toolkits â€” Core Equations

Applied toolkits focus on real-time monitoring and control during barrier transitions. These equations drive instrumentation choices and feedback design.

## Energy Budget Monitor
**Computes cumulative work delivered by actuators.**

$$W(t) = \int_0^t F(\tau) \dot{x}(\tau) d\tau$$

- Integrating force and velocity tracks whether sufficient energy has been injected to reach the barrier, enabling automated cutoffs.

## Escape Detection Threshold
**Defines signal level indicating a successful crossing.**

$$x(t) \geq x_{\mathrm{bar}} \Rightarrow \text{trigger}$$

- Establishing threshold $x_{\mathrm{bar}}$ allows data acquisition systems to log transition times precisely.

## Adaptive Drive Law
**Modulates forcing based on proximity to barrier.**

$$F_{\mathrm{drive}}(t) = K (x_{\mathrm{bar}} - x(t))$$

- A proportional drive ramps down as the system nears the barrier, preventing overshoot beyond the target energy.

## Statistical Ensemble Averaging
**Estimates average crossing time from repeated trials.**

$$\langle \tau \rangle = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M \tau_i$$

- Averaging measured crossing times provides robust performance metrics for toolkit validation.
