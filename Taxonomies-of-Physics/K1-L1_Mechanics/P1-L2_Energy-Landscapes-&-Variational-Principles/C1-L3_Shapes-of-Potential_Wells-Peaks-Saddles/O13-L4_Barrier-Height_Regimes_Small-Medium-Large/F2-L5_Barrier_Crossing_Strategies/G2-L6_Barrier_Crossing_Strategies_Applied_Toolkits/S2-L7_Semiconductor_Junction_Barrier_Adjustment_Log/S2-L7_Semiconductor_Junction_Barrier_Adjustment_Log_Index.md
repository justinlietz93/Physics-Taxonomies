# S2-L7_Semiconductor_Junction_Barrier_Adjustment_Log — Species Index
**Definition:** Tracks fine-tuning of diode or transistor junction barriers during device bring-up.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes

- Tie the story to adjusting bias lights on a workbench until the I–V curve sits in spec.
- List what to capture: doping tweaks, anneal passes, and leakage retests.
