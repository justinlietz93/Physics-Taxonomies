# F2 Barrier Crossing Strategies — Book Suggestions

These books present thermal, driven, and biased barrier crossing methods for mechanical and chemical systems.

## Thermal Activation and Reaction Rates
- *Reaction Rate Theory and Rare Events* — Baron Peters. Explores transition-state theory, Kramers rates, and trajectory sampling for barrier crossing.
- *Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics* — Jeffrey I. Steinfeld, Joseph S. Francisco, & William L. Hase. Discusses activated processes and temperature-dependent crossing strategies.

## Driven and Chaotic Transport
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven H. Strogatz. Covers Melnikov analysis and resonant energy pumping that enable barrier escape.
- *Classical and Quantum Dissipative Systems* — Calin Petrescu. Examines periodically driven escape problems with damping and noise.

## Biasing Techniques and Applications
- *Statistical Mechanics of Nonequilibrium Liquids* — Denis J. Evans & Gary Morriss. Details how external fields bias barrier crossings in transport phenomena.
- *Molecular Driving Forces* — Ken A. Dill & Sarina Bromberg. Provides thermodynamic perspectives on tilting energy landscapes to promote transitions.
