# G2 High-Barrier Protection Plans — Book Suggestions

High barriers protect stable configurations in mechanical, chemical, and electronic systems. These books detail design strategies.

## Reliability & Safety
- *Engineering Reliability: Fundamentals and Applications* — B.S. Dhillon. Covers safety factors and failure probabilities for barrier design.
- *Reliability Physics and Engineering* — J.W. McPherson. Discusses thermally activated failure rates in electronics and materials.

## Energy Absorption & Shock
- *Shock and Vibration Handbook* — Harris & Piersol. Provides methods for estimating shock energies and protection schemes.
- *Design for Impact and Crashworthiness* — Marie Paule Pillet. Highlights energy management strategies in mechanical barriers.

## Thermal Activation & Kinetics
- *Reaction Rate Theory and Rare Events* — Baron Peters. Offers rigorous treatments of Arrhenius rates and barrier crossings.
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — N.G. van Kampen. Discusses escape processes in high-barrier regimes.
