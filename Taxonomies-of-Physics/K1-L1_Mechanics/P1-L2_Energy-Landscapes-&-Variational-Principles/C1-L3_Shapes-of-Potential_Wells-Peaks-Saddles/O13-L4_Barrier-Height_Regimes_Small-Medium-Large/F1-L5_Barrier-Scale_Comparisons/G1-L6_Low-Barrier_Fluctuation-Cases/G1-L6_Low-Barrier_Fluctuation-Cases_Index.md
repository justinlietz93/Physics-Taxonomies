# G1-L6_Low-Barrier_Fluctuation-Cases — Genus Index
**Definition:** Examples where small disturbances can hop the barrier because it sits near the energy level.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Thermostat_Short-Cycle_Review** — HVAC techs diagnose thermostats that chatter because the barrier to switching is too low.
- **S2-L7_USB_Flash_Retention_Check** — Electronics labs check flash memory cells where shallow barriers risk data drift.
