# G1 Low-Barrier Fluctuation Cases â€” Core Equations

When barriers are comparable to thermal energy, fluctuations frequently explore the full well. These equations quantify rates and occupation probabilities.

## Arrhenius Escape Rate
**Estimates transition frequency over a low barrier.**

$$\Gamma = \nu_0 e^{-\Delta U / k_B T}$$

- The small barrier $\Delta U$ leads to sizable escape rate $\Gamma$, showing how low-barrier systems switch states often.

## Occupation Probability Ratio
**Compares population between adjacent wells.**

$$\frac{P_2}{P_1} = e^{-\Delta U / k_B T}$$

- A low barrier yields nearly equal occupation, emphasizing how fluctuations populate both sides of the well.

## Mean Residence Time
**Relates escape rate to dwell time.**

$$\tau = \frac{1}{\Gamma}$$

- The inverse relationship shows that even modest increases in barrier height greatly extend residence times.

## Noise-Driven Energy Spread
**Estimates energy variance due to thermal agitation.**

$$\sigma_E^2 = (k_B T)^2$$

- With low barriers, energy fluctuations on the order of $k_B T$ dominate behavior, reinforcing the need to consider thermal noise in measurements.
