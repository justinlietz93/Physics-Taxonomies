# O13 Barrier-Height Regimes (Small–Medium–Large) — Book Suggestions

Barrier height controls how easily trajectories switch between wells. These references compare weak, moderate, and high barriers across disciplines.

## Low Barrier Dynamics
- *Stochastic Resonance* — L. Gammaitoni et al. (Rev. Mod. Phys.). Highlights low barriers where noise triggers frequent transitions.
- *Chemical Dynamics in Condensed Phases* — Abraham Nitzan. Discusses solvent effects on small barrier crossing.

## Intermediate Barriers
- *Kramers' Turnover Theory* — Peter Hänggi, Peter Talkner, & Michal Borkovec (Rev. Mod. Phys.). Details how escape rates evolve from low to moderate barriers.
- *Transition State Theory* — Wigner & Eyring classics. Provide approximations when barriers are neither negligible nor insurmountable.

## High Barrier Regimes
- *Rare Event Simulation Techniques* — A. F. Voter. Covers accelerated dynamics when barriers are large.
- *Metastability and the Transition State* — Eric Vanden-Eijnden. Discusses large-deviation methods for towering barriers.
