# O4 Multiwell Periodic Lattice — Book Suggestions

Periodic landscapes introduce repeating wells and barriers that underpin crystals, optical lattices, and Josephson arrays. These texts showcase how symmetry and band structure emerge from repeating minima.

## Solid-State & Lattice Foundations
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Builds Bloch-wave intuition for particles in periodic potentials.
- *Solid State Physics* — Neil W. Ashcroft & N. David Mermin. Develops band dispersion from Fourier components of multiwell lattices.

## Cold Atom & Optical Lattices
- *Ultracold Atoms in Optical Lattices* — Maciej Lewenstein et al. Connects sinusoidal wells to tunneling, superfluid–Mott transitions, and Hubbard models.
- *Quantum Simulation with Ultracold Atoms* — Jaksch & Zoller (Rev. Mod. Phys.). Reviews experiments manipulating periodic well depths and spacings.

## Josephson & Phase Arrays
- *Introduction to Superconductivity* — Michael Tinkham. Uses washboard multiwell potentials to explain Josephson phase dynamics.
- *Dynamics of Josephson Junctions and Circuits* — Likharev. Covers multistable periodic potentials, resonances, and switching in superconducting networks.
