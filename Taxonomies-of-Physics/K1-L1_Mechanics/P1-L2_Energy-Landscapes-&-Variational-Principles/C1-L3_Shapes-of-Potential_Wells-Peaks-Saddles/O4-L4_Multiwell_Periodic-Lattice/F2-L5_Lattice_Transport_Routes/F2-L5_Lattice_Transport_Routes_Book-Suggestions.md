# F2 Lattice Transport Routes — Book Suggestions

Transport teams blend hopping-current analytics with bias control and disorder management to keep packets moving coherently through periodic wells.

## Transport Theory & Modeling
- *Solid State Physics* — Ashcroft & Mermin. Canonical coverage of semi-classical transport, mobility, and scattering lengths in periodic lattices.
- *Quantum Transport: Atom to Transistor* — Supriyo Datta. Detailed treatments of tight-binding currents, master equations, and bias-driven flows in lattice channels.

## Numerical & Design Playbooks
- *Computational Methods for Electron Transport* — Enrico Piccinini et al. Offers algorithms for Landau–Zener probabilities, Wannier–Stark ladders, and current continuity checks.
- *Nonlinear Lattice Dynamics* — Michel Remoissenet. Provides DNLS-based transport case studies, highlighting disorder, solitons, and driven route optimization.

## Experimental & Applied Perspectives
- *Cold Atoms in Optical Lattices* — Maciej Lewenstein & Anna Sanpera. Demonstrates laboratory strategies for steering Bloch oscillations, measuring diffusion, and tuning mean free paths.
- *Nanostructured Materials for Advanced Technological Applications* — Yury Gogotsi et al. Application-oriented chapters on lattice-guided transport in phononic, photonic, and electronic devices.
