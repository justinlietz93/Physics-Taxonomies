# F1 Periodic Well Array Playbooks — Book Suggestions

Periodic-well planners pair conceptual texts on lattice potentials with hands-on guides for computing bands and steering transport in repeating energy landscapes.

## Foundations & Theory
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Establishes cosine-lattice potentials, Bloch waves, and effective mass tools that underpin periodic well interpretations.
- *Optical Lattices: Theory* — Maciej Lewenstein et al. Surveys cold-atom lattice derivations, tight-binding reductions, and bias-driven oscillations analogous to mechanical well arrays.

## Computational & Design Workflows
- *Computational Physics of Lattice Systems* — Henk W. Capel. Provides algorithms for band-structure extraction, Wannier function generation, and Landau–Zener simulations on discrete wells.
- *Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation* — Panayotis Kevrekidis. Focuses on DNLS modeling, localized mode stability, and breather design for periodically replicated potentials.

## Experimental & Application Guides
- *Optical Lattices: Cold Atoms in Light Crystal Potentials* — Philippe Courteille et al. Shares lab techniques for tuning depth, alignment, and forcing sequences in real periodic well setups.
- *Mechanical Metamaterials* — Katia Bertoldi et al. Case studies on architected lattices that use repeating wells to program band gaps, transport, and switchable stiffness.
