# F1-L5_Periodic-Well_Array_Playbooks — Family Index
**Definition:** Explores repeating wells and ridges that appear in lattices, washboards, and corrugated surfaces guiding motion.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Genus (L6) — index
- **G1-L6_Crystal-Lattice_Well-Motifs** — catalogue of repeating minima that set where particles prefer to sit.
- **G2-L6_Hopping_Pathway_Visuals** — sketches and timelines showing how travelers hop from well to well across the array.
