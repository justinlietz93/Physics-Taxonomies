# F2 Quadratic Fit Accuracy Checks — Book Suggestions

These titles focus on regression diagnostics, residual analysis, and uncertainty quantification for quadratic approximations.

## Statistical Analysis
- *Applied Regression Analysis* — Norman R. Draper & Harry Smith. Details residual plots, $R^{2}$ interpretation, and F-tests for polynomial fits.
- *Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis* — Douglas C. Montgomery, Elizabeth A. Peck, & G. Geoffrey Vining. Provides statistical diagnostics for verifying quadratic models.

## Experimental Validation
- *Design and Analysis of Experiments* — Douglas C. Montgomery. Discusses response surface methodology and model adequacy checks for quadratic approximations.
- *Engineering Statistics* — Douglas C. Montgomery, George C. Runger, & Norma Faris Hubele. Offers practical tools for estimating uncertainties and validating model fits in engineering labs.

## Numerical Methods
- *Least Squares Data Fitting with Applications* — Per Christian Hansen, Víctor Pereyra, & Godela Scherer. Explains error bounds and stability considerations in polynomial fitting.
- *Statistical Data Analysis* — Glen Cowan. Covers chi-squared tests and higher-order corrections relevant to potential fitting accuracy.
