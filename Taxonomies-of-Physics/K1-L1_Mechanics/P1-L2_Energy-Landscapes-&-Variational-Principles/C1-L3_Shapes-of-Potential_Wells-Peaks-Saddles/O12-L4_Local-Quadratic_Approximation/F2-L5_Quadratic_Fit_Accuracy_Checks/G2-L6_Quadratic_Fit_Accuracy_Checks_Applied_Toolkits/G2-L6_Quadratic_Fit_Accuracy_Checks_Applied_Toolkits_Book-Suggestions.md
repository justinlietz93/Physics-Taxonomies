# G2 Quadratic Fit Accuracy Checks Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Toolkits rely on statistical resampling, sensor calibration, and spectral diagnostics. These books offer practical guidance.

## Resampling & Advanced Statistics
- *Bootstrap Methods and Their Application* — Davison & Hinkley. Explains bootstrap variance estimation in detail.
- *An Introduction to the Bootstrap* — Efron & Tibshirani. Provides practical steps for resampling-based uncertainty.

## Instrument Calibration
- *Calibration: A Technician's Guide* — Mike Cable. Covers procedures for multi-axis sensor calibration matrices.
- *Measurement Systems* — Doebelin & Manik. Discusses weighting strategies for heteroscedastic data.

## Signal Processing
- *Discrete-Time Signal Processing* — Oppenheim & Schafer. Supplies tools for residual spectral analysis.
- *Practical Time-Frequency Analysis* — Patrick Flandrin. Offers methods to detect unmodeled structure in residuals.
