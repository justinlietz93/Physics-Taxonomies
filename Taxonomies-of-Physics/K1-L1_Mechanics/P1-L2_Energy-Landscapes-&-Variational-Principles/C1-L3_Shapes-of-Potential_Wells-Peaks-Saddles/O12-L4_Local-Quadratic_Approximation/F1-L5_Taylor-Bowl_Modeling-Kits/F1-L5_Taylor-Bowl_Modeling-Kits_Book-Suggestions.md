# F1 Taylor Bowl Modeling Kits — Book Suggestions

These resources teach Taylor expansions, curvature extraction, and small-oscillation modeling for local quadratic approximations.

## Mathematical Tools
- *Mathematical Methods for Physicists* — George B. Arfken, Hans J. Weber, & Frank E. Harris. Covers Taylor series, least squares, and error analysis useful for building quadratic models.
- *Advanced Engineering Mathematics* — Erwin Kreyszig. Provides practical formulas for polynomial fitting and differential calculus in applied contexts.

## Mechanics Applications
- *Introduction to Classical Mechanics* — David Morin. Demonstrates Taylor expansions around equilibria and small-oscillation approximations in multiple examples.
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Louis N. Hand & Janet D. Finch. Explains small oscillations and Taylor expansion of potentials from a Lagrangian viewpoint.

## Data Fitting and Metrology
- *Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Philip R. Bevington & D. Keith Robinson. Guides quadratic fitting and uncertainty estimation from experimental potential measurements.
- *Curve Fitting for Programmable Calculators* — William Mendenhall. Offers accessible recipes for fitting quadratics and higher-order polynomials in lab settings.
