# G2 Validity Limit Checks — Book Suggestions

Readers validating quadratic approximations need resources on perturbation theory, error bounds, and experimental verification.

## Perturbation Theory
- *Perturbation Methods* — Ali H. Nayfeh. Provides systematic tools for estimating higher-order corrections and validity ranges.
- *Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers* — Carl M. Bender & Steven A. Orszag. Discusses asymptotic expansions and remainder control.

## Error Analysis
- *Introduction to Numerical Analysis* — J. Stoer & R. Bulirsch. Covers truncation errors and convergence criteria relevant to Taylor expansions.
- *Applied Numerical Methods with MATLAB* — Steven C. Chapra. Offers practical approaches for estimating model validity with data.

## Experimental Cross-Checks
- *Experimental Nonlinear Dynamics* — Jerrold H. Ginsberg. Shows how to detect when higher-order terms emerge in laboratory systems.
- *Engineering Vibrations* — Daniel J. Inman. Provides examples of amplitude-dependent frequency shifts as indicators of model breakdown.
