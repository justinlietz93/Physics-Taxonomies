# O12 Local Quadratic Approximation — Book Suggestions

Quadratic approximations linearize motion near equilibria. These sources explain when and how to apply local harmonic expansions.

## Analytical Foundations
- *Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics* — V. I. Arnol'd. Formalizes Taylor expansion and normal-form reduction near equilibria.
- *Introduction to Perturbation Methods* — Mark H. Holmes. Covers small-parameter expansions leading to quadratic approximations.

## Engineering & Control
- *Linear Systems Theory* — Joao P. Hespanha. Shows how to linearize nonlinear systems around operating points.
- *Modern Control Engineering* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Uses local quadratic models to design controllers near setpoints.

## Quantum & Statistical Approaches
- *Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics II: Fourier Analysis, Self-Adjointness* — Reed & Simon. Discusses harmonic approximations in operator theory.
- *Statistical Mechanics* — Kerson Huang. Employs quadratic expansions to estimate partition functions via Gaussian integrals.
