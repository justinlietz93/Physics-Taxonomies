# O14 Symmetry Preserved vs Broken â€” Core Equations

Symmetry determines whether degenerate minima remain or split. These equations emphasize invariant potentials and symmetry-breaking order parameters.

## Symmetric Potentials
**Invariant under group action:**

$$V(g \cdot q) = V(q)$$

- Symmetry operations $g$ leave the landscape unchanged, leading to degenerate minima related by group transformations.

**Noether charge:**

$$J = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \delta q$$

- Continuous symmetries yield conserved quantities, preventing bias among equivalent wells.

## Symmetry Breaking
**Mexican-hat potential:**

$$V(\phi) = \lambda (\phi^{\dagger} \phi - v^{2})^{2}$$

- Continuous circle of minima emerges; any choice of phase selects a particular vacuum, breaking symmetry spontaneously.

**Landau expansion:**

$$F(\eta) = a(T) \eta^{2} + b \eta^{4} + c \eta^{6} + \cdots$$

- Sign change of $a(T)$ drives symmetry-breaking minima when $b > 0$.

## Order Parameter Dynamics
**Goldstone mode dispersion:**

$$\omega(k) = c k$$

- When continuous symmetry breaks, massless excitations with linear dispersion appear along the degenerate valley.

**Symmetry-breaking perturbation:**

$$V_{\epsilon}(\phi) = V(\phi) - \epsilon (\phi + \phi^{\ast})$$

- Explicit bias $\epsilon$ lifts degeneracy, selecting a preferred minimum and partially restoring symmetry.
