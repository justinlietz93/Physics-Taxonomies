# G1 Symmetry Breaking Signatures Core Scenarios â€” Core Equations

Detecting symmetry breaking relies on measurable signatures in energy, force, and spectra. These equations define common indicators.

## Order Parameter Magnitude
**Tracks emergence of asymmetry.**

$$\eta = \left|\langle x \rangle\right|$$

- Nonzero order parameter indicates symmetry has broken; monitoring its growth maps the transition.

## Energy Splitting
**Measures difference between previously degenerate states.**

$$\Delta E = E_+ - E_-$$

- A finite energy splitting reveals symmetry lifting, whether in oscillators or quantum levels.

## Bifurcation Condition
**Identifies the control parameter where symmetry breaks.**

$$\frac{d\eta}{d\lambda} \to \infty \text{ at } \lambda_c$$

- Divergent susceptibility signals the critical value $\lambda_c$ where symmetry-breaking bifurcation occurs.

## Response Anisotropy
**Compares stiffness along symmetric directions.**

$$\Delta k = k_x - k_y$$

- A nonzero difference between directional stiffnesses provides a straightforward mechanical signature.
