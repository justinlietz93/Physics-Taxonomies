# F2 Symmetry Breaking Signatures — Book Suggestions

Use these resources to catalog measurable indicators that a system has chosen a symmetry-broken state.

## Measurement Techniques
- *Modern Techniques of Surface Science* — D. P. Woodruff & T. A. Delchar. Covers diffraction and spectroscopy signatures for symmetry loss on surfaces and thin films.
- *Neutron Scattering in Condensed Matter Physics* — Albert Furrer et al. Provides reciprocal-space tools to detect magnetic and structural symmetry breaking.

## Statistical and Finite-Size Analysis
- *Finite Size Scaling and Numerical Simulation of Statistical Systems* — Privman (ed.). Introduces Binder cumulants, scaling collapses, and diagnostics for symmetry selection in simulations.
- *Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics* — Newman & Barkema. Demonstrates how to extract susceptibilities, correlation lengths, and structure factors.

## Applied Case Studies
- *Principles of Condensed Matter Physics* — Chaikin & Lubensky. Supplies cross-disciplinary examples of symmetry breaking, from liquid crystals to superfluids, with measurable markers.
- *Phase Transitions in Soft Condensed Matter* — T. Narayanan & A. Kumar. Highlights experimental observables in polymers, colloids, and gels undergoing symmetry changes.
