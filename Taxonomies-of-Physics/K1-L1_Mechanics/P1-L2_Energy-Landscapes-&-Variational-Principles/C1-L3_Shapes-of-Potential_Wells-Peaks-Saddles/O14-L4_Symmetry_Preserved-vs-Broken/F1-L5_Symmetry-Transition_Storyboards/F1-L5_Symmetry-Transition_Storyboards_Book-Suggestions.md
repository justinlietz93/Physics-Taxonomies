# F1 Symmetry Transition Storyboards — Book Suggestions

These titles help teams storyboard how symmetric states tip into asymmetric ones under thermal or field sweeps.

## Conceptual Grounding
- *Statistical Physics of Phase Transitions* — J. M. Yeomans. Offers approachable Landau theory walkthroughs with example energy sketches for different symmetries.
- *Introduction to Phase Transitions and Critical Phenomena* — H. Eugene Stanley. Connects order parameters, critical exponents, and scaling laws for mapping storyboard milestones.

## Experimental Playbooks
- *Phase Transitions in Materials* — Brent Fultz. Details calorimetry, diffraction, and dilatometry methods for detecting symmetry changes in solids.
- *Kinetics of Phase Transitions* — Santhosh Chandra. Discusses quench and anneal scheduling, hysteresis tracking, and metastability diagnostics.

## Simulation and Visualization
- *Computational Physics of Surfaces, Interfaces, and Membranes* — Shigeo Mori & Toshio Suzuki. Provides Monte Carlo and phase-field tools to animate symmetry evolution.
- *Phase-Field Methods in Materials Science and Engineering* — Alain Karma et al. Shows how to parameterize time-dependent Ginzburg–Landau models for transition storyboards.
