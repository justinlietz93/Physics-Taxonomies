# G2 Broken Symmetry Transitions — Book Suggestions

Broken symmetry spans mechanics, condensed matter, and field theory. These books offer multiple perspectives.

## Conceptual Foundations
- *Broken Symmetry* — P.W. Anderson. A collection of essays on how symmetry breaking shapes physics.
- *Statistical Mechanics of Phase Transitions* — J.M. Yeomans. Explains order parameters and symmetry breaking in phase transitions.

## Mechanical & Structural Examples
- *Nonlinear Structural Dynamics* — Balakumar Balachandran & Edward B. Magrab. Discusses bifurcations and symmetry breaking in structures.
- *Structural Stability and Morphogenesis* — René Thom. Provides qualitative insights into symmetry-breaking patterns.

## Quantum & Field Theory
- *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model* — Matthew D. Schwartz. Covers spontaneous symmetry breaking and mass generation.
- *Modern Quantum Mechanics* — J.J. Sakurai & Jim Napolitano. Discusses perturbations that lift degeneracy in symmetric potentials.
