# G1 Preserved Symmetry Cases â€” Core Equations

In preserved-symmetry wells, the potential remains invariant under specific transformations. These equations highlight conserved quantities and diagnostics.

## Symmetric Potential Condition
**Enforces even symmetry about the origin.**

$$V(x) = V(-x)$$

- Verifying this relation confirms the well treats positive and negative displacements identically.

## Conservation of Parity Operator
**States that parity commutes with the Hamiltonian.**

$$[\hat{H}, \hat{P}] = 0$$

- When the commutator vanishes, eigenstates can be labeled by parity, demonstrating preserved symmetry.

## Equal Curvature on Both Sides
**Checks matching stiffness left and right.**

$$V''(x_0^+) = V''(x_0^-)$$

- Identical second derivatives ensure no bias in restoring forces, a tangible measurement for lab systems.

## Degeneracy of Normal Modes
**Confirms symmetry-driven degeneracy.**

$$\omega_{+} = \omega_{-}$$

- Equal frequencies for symmetric oscillation modes signal that symmetry remains intact; splitting would indicate breaking.
