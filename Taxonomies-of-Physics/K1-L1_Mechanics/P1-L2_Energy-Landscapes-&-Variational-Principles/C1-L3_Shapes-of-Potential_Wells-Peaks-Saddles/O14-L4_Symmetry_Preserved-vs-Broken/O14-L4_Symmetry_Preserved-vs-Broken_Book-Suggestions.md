# O14 Symmetry Preserved vs Broken — Book Suggestions

Symmetry controls degeneracy, bifurcations, and the emergence of new minima. These works compare landscapes that respect symmetry with those where it breaks.

## Group Theory Foundations
- *Group Theory and Its Application to Physical Problems* — Morton Hamermesh. Explains symmetry operations and invariant potentials.
- *Symmetry in Mechanics* — Stephanie Singer. Connects group actions to conserved quantities and symmetric wells.

## Symmetry Breaking
- *Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Classical and Quantum Systems* — Gilmore & Knudsen. Surveys how potentials develop new minima when symmetry breaks.
- *Pattern Formation and Dynamics in Nonequilibrium Systems* — Michael Cross & Henry Greenside. Shows how symmetry-breaking instabilities reshape landscapes.

## Applications
- *The Higgs Hunter's Guide* — Gunion et al. Discusses Mexican-hat potentials with broken gauge symmetry.
- *Phase Transitions* — Nigel Goldenfeld. Links order parameters and symmetry-breaking wells across materials.
