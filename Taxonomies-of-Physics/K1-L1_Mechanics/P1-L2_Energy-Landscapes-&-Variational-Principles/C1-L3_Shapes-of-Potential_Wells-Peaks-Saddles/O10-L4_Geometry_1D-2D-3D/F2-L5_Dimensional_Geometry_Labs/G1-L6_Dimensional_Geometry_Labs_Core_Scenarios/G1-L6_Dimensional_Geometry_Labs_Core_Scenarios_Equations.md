# G1 Dimensional Geometry Labs Core Scenarios â€” Core Equations

Lab activities compare 1D tracks, 2D bowls, and 3D traps. These relations support core measurements when students shift between setups.

## Calibration of 2D Bowl Curvature
**Extracts stiffness from radial displacement.**

$$k = \frac{F_r}{r}$$

- Measuring radial force $F_r$ at displacement $r$ provides the effective curvature, enabling comparisons with the 1D track stiffness.

## Mapping Height Profiles
**Converts height maps to potential energy.**

$$V(r) = mg h(r)$$

- Height $h(r)$ measured in a lab bowl translates directly to potential energy, helping students visualize equipotential contours.

## Time-of-Flight on Inclined Tracks
**Relates measured travel times to geometry.**

$$t = \sqrt{\frac{2\Delta s}{g \sin \theta}}$$

- Rolling along an incline of angle $\theta$ offers a 1D reference case; matching times across tracks shows how geometry alters acceleration.

## Restoring Force from 3D Trap Springs
**Combines orthogonal measurements.**

$$F = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2 + F_z^2}$$

- Summing orthogonal components demonstrates how 3D wells superimpose independent stiffnesses, giving students a tangible vector comparison.
