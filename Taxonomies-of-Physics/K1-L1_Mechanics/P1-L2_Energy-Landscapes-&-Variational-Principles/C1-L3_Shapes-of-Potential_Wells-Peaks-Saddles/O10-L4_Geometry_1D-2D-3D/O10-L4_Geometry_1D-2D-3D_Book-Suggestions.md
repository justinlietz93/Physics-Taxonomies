# O10 Geometry 1D–2D–3D — Book Suggestions

Dimensionality reshapes how wells behave, from line traps to volumetric basins. These references compare geometric effects across 1D, 2D, and 3D landscapes.

## One-Dimensional Essentials
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Treats 1D potentials as baseline for energy diagrams.
- *Quantum Mechanics: An Accessible Introduction* — Robert Scherrer. Uses 1D wells to illustrate bound states and tunneling basics.

## Two-Dimensional Wells
- *Introduction to Classical Mechanics with Problems and Solutions* — David Morin. Features 2D potential contour analysis and stability classification.
- *Two-Dimensional Electron Systems* — Tsui & Stormer. Examines confinement in planar wells relevant to semiconductor heterostructures.

## Three-Dimensional Traps
- *Atomic Physics* — Christopher J. Foot. Discusses 3D harmonic and magnetic traps for cold atoms.
- *Molecular Vibrations* — E. Bright Wilson Jr. et al. Explains 3D normal modes in polyatomic molecules.
