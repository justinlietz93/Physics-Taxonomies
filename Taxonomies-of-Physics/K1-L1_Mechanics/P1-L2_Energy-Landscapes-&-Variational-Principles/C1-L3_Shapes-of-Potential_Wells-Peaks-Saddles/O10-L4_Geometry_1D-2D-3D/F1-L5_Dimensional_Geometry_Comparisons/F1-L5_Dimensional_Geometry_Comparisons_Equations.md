# F1 Dimensional Geometry Comparisons â€” Core Equations

Potential wells differ across one-, two-, and three-dimensional geometries. These formulas compare confinement volumes, density of states, and geometric scaling that influence mechanics experiments.

## Spatial Volume and Surface Scaling
**1D segment length:**

$$L = x_{\max} - x_{\min}$$

- In one dimension the accessible region is an interval whose length governs normalization of probability densities.

**2D area and 3D volume:**

$$A = \pi r^{2}, \qquad V = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$$

- For circular or spherical wells, area and volume scale with $r^{2}$ and $r^{3}$ respectively, impacting mass distribution and energy storage.

## Density of States and Mode Counts
**Radial mode spacing in 2D vs. 3D:**

$$N(\omega) \propto \begin{cases}
\omega^{2} & \text{2D isotropic well} \\
\omega^{3} & \text{3D isotropic well}
\end{cases}$$

- Higher dimensions offer more modes at high frequency, changing how energy populates vibrational states.

**Equipartition contributions:**

$$E_{\text{thermal}} = \frac{f}{2} k_{\mathrm{B}} T$$

- Degrees of freedom $f = 1, 2, 3$ for 1D, 2D, 3D wells set the thermal energy budget and RMS displacement scales.

## Geometric Stiffness Scaling
**Effective spring constants:**

$$k_{\text{rod}} = \frac{EA}{L}, \quad k_{\text{plate}} = \frac{16 D}{\pi a^{2}}, \quad k_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{3 K V}{R}$$

- Illustrative scaling for axial rods, clamped circular plates, and bulk compression shows how dimensionality alters stiffness through area moment $D$, bulk modulus $K$, and geometric parameters.
