# F1 Dimensional Geometry Comparisons — Book Suggestions

These references contrast one-, two-, and three-dimensional confinement to show how geometry alters mode structure and energy storage.

## Foundational Texts
- *The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. II* — Richard P. Feynman, Robert B. Leighton, & Matthew Sands. Discusses potential wells and dimensional effects on oscillations and electrostatics.
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Provides examples of constrained motion in 1D, 2D, and 3D wells, highlighting energy and normalization differences.

## Vibrations and Structural Analysis
- *Theory of Vibrations with Applications* — William T. Thomson. Compares string, membrane, and solid resonances with attention to geometric scaling.
- *Plates and Shells* — Ansel C. Ugural. Explores how geometry influences stiffness and mode distribution in 2D vs. 3D structures.

## Experimental Demonstrations
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A. P. French. Offers laboratory-friendly demonstrations across dimensional geometries.
- *The Physics Teacher’s Handbook of Demonstrations* — Donna M. Crowther. Includes comparative experiments showing how geometry modifies oscillation frequencies and energy distribution.
