# G1 One-Dimensional Motion Tracks â€” Core Equations

Comparing wells in different dimensions starts with the 1D case. These equations describe motion confined to a single coordinate so students can benchmark higher-dimensional results.

## One-Dimensional Harmonic Potential
**Defines the baseline quadratic well.**

$$V(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}k x^2$$

- Motion along a straight track depends only on displacement $x$, making this form the reference for dimensional comparisons.

## Equation of Motion
**Relates force to displacement along the track.**

$$m \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + k x = 0$$

- Including damping $c$ highlights how friction alters 1D relaxation, offering a direct contrast with multi-axis cases where coupling appears.

## Time-of-Flight Between Points
**Computes travel time under constant acceleration.**

$$t = \sqrt{\frac{2\Delta x}{a}}$$

- For 1D ramps driven by constant acceleration $a$, this simple square-root relation aids in calibrating demonstrators before adding curvature.

## Energy Conservation
**Balances kinetic and potential energy along the track.**

$$E = \tfrac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} k x^2$$

- Tracking how energy swaps between kinetic and potential along a line sets expectations for additional modes that appear in 2D and 3D wells.
