# G1 One-Dimensional Motion Tracks — Book Suggestions

These resources anchor the simplest geometry case before expanding to higher-dimensional wells.

## Introductory Mechanics
- *Physics for Scientists and Engineers* — Serway & Jewett. Provides clear examples of 1D motion and harmonic oscillators.
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Offers detailed derivations for 1D potentials and energy conservation.

## Laboratory Guides
- *An Introduction to Error Analysis* — John R. Taylor. Helps students design and analyze single-axis track experiments.
- *Physics Lab Manual* — David Loyd. Contains hands-on exercises involving linear tracks and springs.

## Transition to Higher Dimensions
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Fowles & Cassiday. Bridges 1D systems to multi-dimensional generalizations.
- *Mechanics* — L.D. Landau & E.M. Lifshitz. Uses the 1D harmonic oscillator as a stepping stone to central-force and multidimensional wells.
