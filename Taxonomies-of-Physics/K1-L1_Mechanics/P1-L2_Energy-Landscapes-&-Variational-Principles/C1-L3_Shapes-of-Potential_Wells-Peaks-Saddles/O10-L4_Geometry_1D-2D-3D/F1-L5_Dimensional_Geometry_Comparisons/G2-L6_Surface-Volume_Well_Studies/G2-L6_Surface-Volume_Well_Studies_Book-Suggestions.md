# G2 Surface-Volume Well Studies — Book Suggestions

Understanding dimensional effects requires statistical mechanics, geometry, and computational modeling. These titles bridge those areas.

## Statistical Mechanics & Phase Space
- *Statistical Mechanics* — Franz Mandl. Explains density of states and dimensional scaling in harmonic wells.
- *Thermal Physics* — Daniel V. Schroeder. Provides accessible discussions of equipartition and multi-dimensional oscillators.

## Geometry & Integration
- *Calculus of Several Variables* — Serge Lang. Offers tools for integrating over high-dimensional volumes.
- *Geometric Measure Theory* — Herbert Federer. Gives deeper insight into volume calculations for advanced readers.

## Computational Modeling
- *Computational Physics* — Nicholas J. Giordano & Hisao Nakanishi. Demonstrates Monte Carlo sampling in higher-dimensional wells.
- *Molecular Dynamics Simulation: Elementary Methods* — J.M. Haile. Shows how dimensionality affects energy distribution in simulations.
