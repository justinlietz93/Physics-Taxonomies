# G2 Surface-Volume Well Studies â€” Core Equations

Higher-dimensional wells add area and volume scaling that change thermal occupancy and energy distribution. These formulas compare geometry effects.

## Radial Potential in 2D and 3D
**Shows how energy depends on radius in higher dimensions.**

$$V(r) = \tfrac{1}{2}k r^2$$

- The same quadratic form applies, but now radius $r$ lives in a plane (2D) or space (3D), setting up comparisons of accessible phase space.

## Density of States
**Counts microstates as a function of energy.**

$$g(E) \propto E^{d/2 - 1}$$

- For dimension $d$, the density of states scales with $E^{d/2 - 1}$, showing how more dimensions boost high-energy occupancy.

## Equipartition per Degree of Freedom
**Allocates thermal energy across coordinates.**

$$\langle E \rangle = \frac{d}{2} k_B T$$

- Each dimension contributes $\tfrac{1}{2}k_B T$, so the total average energy rises with dimension, explaining broader distributions in 3D wells.

## Volume of Constant-Energy Surface
**Relates energy to accessible configuration volume.**

$$V_d(E) = C_d \left(\frac{2E}{k}\right)^{d/2}$$

- Constant-energy ellipsoids grow with energy differently in 2D and 3D; the coefficient $C_d$ depends on geometry (circle vs. sphere), guiding occupancy analyses.
