# O10 Geometry 1D–2D–3D — Core Equations

Dimensionality changes density of states, curvature, and confinement. These equations compare common measures across 1D, 2D, and 3D wells.

## Harmonic Well Scaling
**Potential form:**

$$V(\mathbf{r}) = \tfrac{1}{2} m (\omega_{x}^{2} x^{2} + \omega_{y}^{2} y^{2} + \omega_{z}^{2} z^{2})$$

- In 1D only one frequency remains; in 2D and 3D multiple curvatures coexist.

**Zero-point energy:**

$$E_{0} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\omega_{x} + \omega_{y} + \omega_{z})$$

- Summing present frequencies reveals how dimensionality lifts ground-state energy.

## Density of States
**1D harmonic ladder:**

$$E_{n} = \hbar \omega \left(n + \tfrac{1}{2}\right)$$

- Levels equally spaced; degeneracy $g_{n} = 1$.

**3D isotropic degeneracy:**

$$E_{n} = \hbar \omega \left(n + \tfrac{3}{2}\right), \quad g_{n} = \tfrac{1}{2}(n+1)(n+2)$$

- Higher dimension multiplies states at each energy due to angular momentum combinations.

## Volume of Confinement
**Equipotential radius:**

$$r_{E} = \sqrt{\frac{2(E - V_{0})}{m \omega^{2}}}$$

- The accessible volume scales as $2 r_{E}$ in 1D, $\pi r_{E}^{2}$ in 2D, and $\tfrac{4}{3} \pi r_{E}^{3}$ in 3D, demonstrating how dimensionality expands phase space.
