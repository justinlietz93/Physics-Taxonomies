# G1 Sampling and Annealing Routines Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Stochastic searches explore rugged landscapes by accepting occasional uphill moves to escape local minima.

## Monte Carlo Foundations
* *Monte Carlo Statistical Methods* — Robert & Casella. Explains Metropolis acceptance and sampling theory.
* *Statistical Mechanics* — Pathria & Beale. Provides Boltzmann distributions underlying annealing.
## Annealing Applications
* *Simulated Annealing: Theory and Applications* — van Laarhoven & Aarts. Classic text on cooling schedules.
* *Optimization by Simulated Annealing* — Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, & Vecchi. Landmark paper illustrating annealing on combinatorial problems.
