# G2 Sampling and Annealing Routines Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Practitioners tune proposal distributions, reheating strategies, and parallel tempering ladders.

## Algorithm Tuning
* *Handbook of Metaheuristics* — Gendreau & Potvin. Offers guidelines for proposal scaling and reheating.
* *Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice* — Gilks, Richardson, & Spiegelhalter. Discusses adaptive proposals and tempering.
## Software Recipes
* *Numerical Recipes* — Press et al. Includes code for annealing and parallel tempering implementations.
* *Practical Optimization with Metaheuristics* — Yang. Provides parameter tuning checklists for annealing variants.
