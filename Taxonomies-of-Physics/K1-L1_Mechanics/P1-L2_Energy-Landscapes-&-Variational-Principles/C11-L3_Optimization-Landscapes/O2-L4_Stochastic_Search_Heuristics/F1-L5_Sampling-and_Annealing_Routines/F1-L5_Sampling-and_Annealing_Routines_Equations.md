# F1 Sampling and Annealing Routines â€” Core Equations

Stochastic search methods sample the landscape using probabilistic acceptance rules. These equations cover simulated annealing and Metropolis sampling.

## Metropolis Acceptance Rule
**Transition probability:**

$$P(\Delta U) = \min \left(1, e^{-\Delta U / (k_{B} T)} \right)$$

- Energy increases $\Delta U$ are accepted with Boltzmann-weighted probability at effective temperature $T$.

## Cooling Schedule
**Logarithmic decay for convergence:**

$$T_{k} = \frac{T_{0}}{\log(k + k_{0})}$$

- Slowly decreasing temperature ensures convergence to global optimum under theoretical guarantees.

## Sampling Average
**Monte Carlo estimator:**

$$\langle f \rangle \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} f(\mathbf{x}_{i})$$

- Expectation values estimated via samples $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ generated by annealing process, guiding acceptance criteria and diagnostics.
