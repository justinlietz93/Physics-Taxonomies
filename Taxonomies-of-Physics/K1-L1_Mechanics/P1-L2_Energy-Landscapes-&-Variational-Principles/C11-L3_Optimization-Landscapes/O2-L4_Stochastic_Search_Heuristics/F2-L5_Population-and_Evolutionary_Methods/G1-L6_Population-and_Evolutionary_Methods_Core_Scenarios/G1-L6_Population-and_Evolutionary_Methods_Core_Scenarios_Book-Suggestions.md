# G1 Population and Evolutionary Methods Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Evolutionary algorithms maintain a population of candidate solutions, combining selection, crossover, and mutation to explore landscapes.

## Evolutionary Foundations
* *Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning* — Goldberg. Classic reference on selection and crossover.
* *Evolutionary Computation* — Bäck, Fogel, & Michalewicz. Surveys algorithm variants and theory.
## Application Examples
* *Practical Genetic Algorithms* — Haupt & Haupt. Provides engineering case studies.
* *Engineering Optimization with Metaheuristic Algorithms* — Yang. Demonstrates evolutionary methods on design problems.
