# O2 Stochastic Search Heuristics — Book Suggestions

Stochastic search heuristics mix randomness with local rules to escape traps and explore rugged landscapes. These books cover simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, and swarm methods with practical guidance.

## Foundational Texts
- *Simulated Annealing: Theory and Applications* — P.J. van Laarhoven & E.H. Aarts. Explains the statistical mechanics analogy that underpins temperature schedules.
- *Introduction to Evolutionary Computing* — A.E. Eiben & J.E. Smith. Covers genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and parameter choices.
- *Essentials of Metaheuristics* — Sean Luke. Provides a broad survey of modern stochastic heuristics with implementation tips.

## Specialized Heuristics
- *Particle Swarm Optimization* — Maurice Clerc. Focuses on swarm-based search and convergence behavior.
- *Ant Colony Optimization* — Marco Dorigo & Thomas Stützle. Details pheromone-based heuristics for combinatorial landscapes.
- *Tabu Search* — Fred Glover & Manuel Laguna. Introduces memory-based stochastic search for escaping local minima.

## Applications & Practice
- *Engineering Optimization: Theory and Practice* — S.S. Rao. Illustrates stochastic heuristics on mechanical design and control problems.
- *Metaheuristics: From Design to Implementation* — El-Ghazali Talbi. Bridges theory with software frameworks and hybrid strategies.
- *Data-Driven Evolutionary Optimization* — Yaochu Jin (ed.). Highlights surrogate-assisted and adaptive heuristics for expensive simulations.
