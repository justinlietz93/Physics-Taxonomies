# C11 Optimization Landscapes — Book Suggestions

Optimization landscapes borrow physics language to navigate high-dimensional cost surfaces. These books introduce the shared vocabulary of convexity, saddle avoidance, and landscape smoothing used across mechanics and algorithms.

## Foundational Texts
- *Convex Optimization* — Stephen Boyd & Lieven Vandenberghe. Establishes convex landscape geometry, duality, and descent guarantees that anchor the class terminology.
- *First-Order Methods in Optimization* — Amir Beck. Surveys gradient and proximal schemes while emphasizing landscape properties like smoothness and Lipschitz bounds.

## Nonconvex & Global Views
- *Nonconvex Optimization for Machine Learning* — Prateek Jain & Purushottam Kar. Discusses saddles, escape mechanisms, and landscape flattening strategies in high dimensions.
- *Optimization by Vector Space Methods* — David Luenberger. Provides geometric insight into level sets, projections, and dual landscapes beyond convex settings.

## Physics-Inspired Approaches
- *Information Geometry and Its Applications* — Shun-ichi Amari. Frames optimization as motion on curved statistical manifolds, connecting to metric choices in landscape traversal.
- *Simulated Annealing: Theory and Applications* — P. J. M. van Laarhoven & E. H. L. Aarts. Shows how thermal metaphors reshape rugged landscapes to locate near-global minima.
