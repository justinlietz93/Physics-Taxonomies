# G2-L6_First-Order_Techniques_Applied_Toolkits — Genus Index
**Definition:** Applied toolkits that keep gradient-style updates humming inside production systems.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- **S1-L7_Warehouse_Routing_First-Order_Kit** — operations kit using gradients to smooth warehouse picker routes.
- **S2-L7_DSP_Filter_First-Order_Retuning_Log** — signal lab log capturing first-order tweaks during live filter retuning.
