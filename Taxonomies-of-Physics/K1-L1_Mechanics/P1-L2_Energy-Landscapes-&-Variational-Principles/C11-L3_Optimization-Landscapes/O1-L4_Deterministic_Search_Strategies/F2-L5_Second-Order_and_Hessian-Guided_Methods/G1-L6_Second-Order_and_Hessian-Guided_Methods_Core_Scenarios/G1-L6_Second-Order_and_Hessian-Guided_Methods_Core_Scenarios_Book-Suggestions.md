# G1 Second-Order and Hessian-Guided Methods Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Newton-style methods use curvature information to jump directly toward minima, achieving quadratic convergence when Hessians are well behaved.

## Second-Order Theory
* *Numerical Optimization* — Nocedal & Wright. Explains Newton, BFGS, and trust-region theory.
* *Practical Optimization* — Gill, Murray, & Wright. Covers convergence proofs and curvature conditions.
## Application Guides
* *Engineering Optimization* — Rao. Demonstrates second-order methods on mechanical design problems.
* *Computational Chemistry* — Leach. Shows Hessian-guided geometry optimization examples.
