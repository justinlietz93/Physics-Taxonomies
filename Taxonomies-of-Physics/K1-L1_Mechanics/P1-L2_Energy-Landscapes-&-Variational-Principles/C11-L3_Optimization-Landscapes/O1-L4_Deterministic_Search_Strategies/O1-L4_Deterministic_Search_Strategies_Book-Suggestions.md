# O1 Deterministic Search Strategies — Book Suggestions

Deterministic search strategies follow fixed rules to traverse energy landscapes toward optima. These books cover line search, trust-region, and deterministic global methods that guarantee reproducible progress.

## Foundational Algorithms
- *Numerical Optimization* — Jorge Nocedal & Stephen Wright. The standard reference for gradient-based deterministic methods, including line searches and trust regions.
- *Convex Optimization* — Stephen Boyd & Lieven Vandenberghe. Provides convergence proofs and geometric intuition for convex landscapes.
- *Introduction to Nonlinear Optimization* — Amir Beck. Offers a modern treatment of descent methods with clear step-by-step algorithms.

## Deterministic Global Strategies
- *Deterministic Global Optimization: Theory, Methods and Applications* — Christodoulos A. Floudas. Surveys branch-and-bound, cutting planes, and convex relaxations.
- *Global Optimization* — Reiner Horst, Panos M. Pardalos, & Nguyen V. Thoai. Presents deterministic approaches for nonconvex problems, including interval methods.
- *Deterministic Operations Research* — David J. Rader. Provides algorithmic detail on network flows, integer programming, and deterministic decision tools.

## Applications & Software
- *Practical Methods of Optimization* — R. Fletcher. Focuses on implementable algorithms with convergence guarantees.
- *Engineering Optimization* — Singiresu S. Rao. Applies deterministic search to structural, mechanical, and control design problems.
- *Handbook of Test Problems in Local and Global Optimization* — Christodoulos A. Floudas & Panos M. Pardalos. Supplies benchmark problems for validating deterministic strategies.
