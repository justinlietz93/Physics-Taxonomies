# G1 Color and Correlation Effects Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Colored-noise scenarios characterize how finite correlation times reshape transition rates and responses. These references ground core classroom analyses.

## Noise Fundamentals
* *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — van Kampen. Derives autocorrelation and spectra for common colored-noise models.
* *Stochastic Differential Equations* — Øksendal. Provides mathematical foundations for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck and related generators.

## Physical Illustrations
* *Noise in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems, Vol. 1* — Moss & McClintock. Explores colored noise impacts on barrier crossing and resonance.
* *An Introduction to Stochastic Processes with Applications to Physics and Engineering* — Gardiner. Features worked examples of correlation-controlled response functions.
