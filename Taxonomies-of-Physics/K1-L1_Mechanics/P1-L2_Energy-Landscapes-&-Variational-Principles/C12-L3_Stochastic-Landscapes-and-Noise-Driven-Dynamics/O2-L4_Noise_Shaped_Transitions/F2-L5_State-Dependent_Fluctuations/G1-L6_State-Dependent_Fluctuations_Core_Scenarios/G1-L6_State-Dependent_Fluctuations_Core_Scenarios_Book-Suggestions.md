# G1 State-Dependent Fluctuations Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

State-dependent fluctuations change diffusion strength with position, leading to multiplicative noise behavior in core examples.

## Theory Foundations
* *Handbook of Stochastic Methods* — Gardiner. Details multiplicative noise calculus and the corresponding Fokker–Planck forms.
* *Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics* — Zwanzig. Discusses effective potentials and projection methods for state-dependent diffusion.

## Application Highlights
* *Noise-Induced Transitions* — Horsthemke & Lefever. Surveys physical systems where state-dependent noise shifts stability.
* *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — van Kampen. Provides comparison of Itô vs Stratonovich interpretations for multiplicative noise.
