# G2 State-Dependent Fluctuations Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Applied toolkits estimate transition rates and implement numerical schemes when diffusion strength depends on the state.

## Numerical Methods
* *Stochastic Numerics for Mathematical Physics* — Kloeden & Platen. Details Milstein and higher-order integrators for multiplicative noise.
* *Computational Stochastic Dynamics* — Klebaner & Lian. Offers algorithmic recipes for extracting Kramers–Moyal coefficients from data.

## Engineering Applications
* *Stochastic Methods in Structural Dynamics* — Ghanem & Spanos. Applies state-dependent diffusion ideas to reliability assessments.
* *Chemical Kinetics and Chain Reactions* — Hänggi & Talkner. Discusses escape-rate prefactors under multiplicative noise in reaction engineering.
