# F2 State-Dependent Fluctuations — Book Suggestions

These references focus on multiplicative noise, stochastic calculus, and noise-induced drift phenomena.

## Stochastic Calculus
- *Stochastic Differential Equations and Applications* — Avner Friedman. Provides Itô and Stratonovich calculus with physical interpretations.
- *The Fokker–Planck Equation* — Hannes Risken. Discusses multiplicative noise and associated drift corrections.

## Noise-Induced Phenomena
- *Noise-Induced Transitions* — Horsthemke & Lefever. Classic text on how state-dependent noise modifies bifurcations and steady states.
- *Stochastic Dynamics and Irreversibility* — R. L. Stratonovich. Explores systems with multiplicative noise and energy landscapes.

## Applied Examples
- *Stochastic Methods in Neuroscience* — Carlo Laing & Gabriel Lord (eds.). Demonstrates state-dependent noise in neural models.
- *Stochastic Chemical Kinetics* — Péter Érdi & László Tóth. Covers multiplicative noise in reaction networks.
