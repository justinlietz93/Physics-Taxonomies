# O2 Noise-Shaped Transitions — Book Suggestions

Noise-shaped transitions explore how colored, multiplicative, or non-Gaussian noise alters transition pathways. These books explain noise spectra, stochastic calculus variants, and modeling strategies for tailored fluctuations.

## Foundations of Stochastic Forcing
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — N.G. van Kampen. Covers additive and multiplicative noise, noise spectra, and Fokker–Planck formalisms.
- *Stochastic Differential Equations: An Introduction with Applications* — Bernt Øksendal. Provides Ito and Stratonovich calculus tools for handling noise with state-dependent amplitudes.
- *Colored Noise in Dynamical Systems* — R.F. Fox & T.C. Elston. Explains how finite correlation times modify escape dynamics and effective potentials.

## Noise Shaping & Control
- *Handbook of Stochastic Methods* — Crispin W. Gardiner. Details how to construct Langevin equations with specific noise correlations and derive corresponding Fokker–Planck equations.
- *Stochastic Climate Models* — Peter Imkeller & Jürgen von Storch (eds.). Demonstrates how colored noise and stochastic parameterizations shape large-scale transitions.
- *Noise-Induced Phenomena in Physics* — Yukito Tanimura & V.I. Melnikov (eds.). Discusses engineering of noise spectra to trigger or suppress transitions.

## Applications & Computation
- *Nonlinear Stochastic Control* — Boris T. Polyak. Uses noise shaping within control loops to achieve desired transition statistics.
- *Stochastic Resonance: Theory and Applications* — Luca Gammaitoni et al. Explores how structured noise amplifies weak signals and induces transitions.
- *Computational Methods for Stochastic Dynamics* — Peter E. Kloeden & Eckhard Platen. Presents numerical schemes tailored to multiplicative and colored noise processes.
