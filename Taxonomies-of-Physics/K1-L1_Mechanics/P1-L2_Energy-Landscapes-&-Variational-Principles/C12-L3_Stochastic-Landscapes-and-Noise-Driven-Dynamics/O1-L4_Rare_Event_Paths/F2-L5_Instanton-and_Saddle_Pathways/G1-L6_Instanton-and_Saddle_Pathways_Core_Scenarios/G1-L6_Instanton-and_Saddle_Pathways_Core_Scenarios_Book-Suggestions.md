# G1 Instanton and Saddle Pathways Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Instantons describe most-likely escape paths through saddles in the weak-noise limit.

## Instanton Basics
* *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — van Kampen. Introduces WKB/instanton analysis for escape problems.
* *Path Integrals and Quantum Processes* — Schulman. Discusses instanton solutions in classical and quantum contexts.
## Applications
* *Noise-Induced Transitions* — Horsthemke & Lefever. Provides saddle-path examples in chemical kinetics.
* *Transition Path Theory for Markov Processes* — E, Vanden-Eijnden. Relates instantons to transition pathways.
