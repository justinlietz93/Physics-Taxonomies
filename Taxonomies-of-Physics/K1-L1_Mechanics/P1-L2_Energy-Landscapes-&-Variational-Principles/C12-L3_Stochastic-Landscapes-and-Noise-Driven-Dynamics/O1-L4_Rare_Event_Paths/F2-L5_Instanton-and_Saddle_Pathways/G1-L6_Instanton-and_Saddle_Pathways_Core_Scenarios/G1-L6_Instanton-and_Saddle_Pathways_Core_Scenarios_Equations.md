# G1 Instanton and Saddle Pathways Core Scenarios â€” Core Equations

Instantons describe most-likely escape paths through saddles in the weak-noise limit.

## Euler-Lagrange for Instanton
**Stationary condition for the action functional.**

$$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 0$$

- For overdamped Langevin dynamics, $L = rac{1}{4D} (\dot{x}+
abla V)^{2}$, yielding time-reversed gradient flow.
## Time-Reversal Symmetry
**Instanton follows negative gradient in reverse time.**

$$\dot{x}^{*} = +\nabla V(x^{*})$$

- The optimal escape trajectory ascends the potential, opposite deterministic relaxation.
## Action Value
**Evaluated along instanton path.**

$$I_{min} = \int_{0}^{T} \frac{1}{4D} (\dot{x}^{*}+\nabla V(x^{*}))^{2} dt$$

- Plugging in the instanton solution yields barrier height divided by noise strength.
