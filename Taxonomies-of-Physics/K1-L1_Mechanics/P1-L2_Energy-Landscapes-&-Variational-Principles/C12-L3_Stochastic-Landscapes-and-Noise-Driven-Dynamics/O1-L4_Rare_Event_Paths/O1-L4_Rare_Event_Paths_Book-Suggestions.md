# O1 Rare Event Paths — Book Suggestions

Rare event paths describe how systems escape metastable wells under weak noise. These books combine large-deviation theory, transition-state concepts, and numerical sampling strategies to capture the most probable escape trajectories.

## Theoretical Foundations
- *Freidlin and Wentzell's Random Perturbations of Dynamical Systems* — M.I. Freidlin & A.D. Wentzell. The classic reference on large-deviation principles for rare transitions.
- *Large Deviations Techniques and Applications* — Amir Dembo & Ofer Zeitouni. Provides rigorous proofs and examples for action minimization of rare paths.
- *Noise-Induced Transitions* — Horsthemke & Lefever. Connects stochastic dynamics with qualitative descriptions of rare events and bifurcations.

## Computational Methods
- *Transition Path Sampling* — Peter G. Bolhuis et al. (Reviews in Computational Chemistry). Surveys importance sampling algorithms for rare-event simulations.
- *Transition Path Theory for Markov Processes* — Vanden-Eijnden & E, in *Handbook of Dynamical Systems*. Offers mathematical tools for computing reactive trajectories.
- *Rare Event Simulation using Monte Carlo Methods* — Rubinstein & Kroese. Presents splitting, importance sampling, and cross-entropy methods for estimating rare probabilities.

## Applications
- *Energy Landscapes: Applications to Clusters, Biomolecules and Glasses* — David J. Wales. Demonstrates rare-event pathways in chemistry and materials science.
- *Molecular Driving Forces* — Ken A. Dill & Sarina Bromberg. Discusses transition states and reaction pathways in molecular systems under thermal noise.
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — N.G. van Kampen. Provides case studies of escape problems and noise-induced transitions across physics disciplines.
