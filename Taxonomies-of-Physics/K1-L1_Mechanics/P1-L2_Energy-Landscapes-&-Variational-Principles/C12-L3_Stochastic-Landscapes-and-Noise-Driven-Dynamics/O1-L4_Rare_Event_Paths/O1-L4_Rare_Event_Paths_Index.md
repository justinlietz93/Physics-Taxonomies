# O1-L4_Rare_Event_Paths — Order Index
**Definition:** Use action-like ideas to find optimal fluctuation paths that drive rare events.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Large-Deviation_Roadmaps** — rate-function tools that score improbable excursions.
- **F2-L5_Instanton-and_Saddle_Pathways** — dominant paths through stochastic landscapes for escapes.
