# F2 Field and Gauge Variations — Book Suggestions

These references extend variational methods to fields, gauge theories, and continuum systems.

## Field Theory Texts
- *Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity* — John Baez & Javier P. Muniain. Introduces gauge variations and conserved currents with geometric insight.
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John David Jackson. Derives Maxwell’s equations from the action principle and explores gauge invariance.

## Advanced Mechanics and Symmetry
- *Noether’s Theorems: Invariance and Conservation Laws in the Twentieth Century* — Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach. Explains Noether currents for gauge symmetries.
- *Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formalism for Field Theory* — S. P. Novikov et al. Provides mathematical detail on field variations.

## Continuum and Applied Perspectives
- *Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics* — Ellad B. Tadmor & Ronald E. Miller. Uses variational formulations for solids and fluids.
- *Field and Wave Electromagnetics* — David K. Cheng. Presents variational derivations for electromagnetic boundary-value problems.
