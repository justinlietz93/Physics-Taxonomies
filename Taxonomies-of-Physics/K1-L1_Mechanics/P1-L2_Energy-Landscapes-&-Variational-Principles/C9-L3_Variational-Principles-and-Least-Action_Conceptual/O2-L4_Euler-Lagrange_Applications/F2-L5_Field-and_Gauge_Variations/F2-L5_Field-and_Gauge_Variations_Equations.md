# F2 Field and Gauge Variations — Core Equations

Extending Euler–Lagrange equations to fields and gauge potentials underpins continuum and electromagnetic mechanics. These equations summarize common forms.

## Field Euler–Lagrange Equation
**General statement:**

$$\partial_{\mu} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_{\mu} \phi)} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} = 0$$

- Variation of action with respect to field $\phi$ yields partial differential equations governing field dynamics.

## Electromagnetic Gauge Field
**Maxwell equations from action:**

$$\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} - J_{\mu} A^{\mu}, \qquad F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu} A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$$

- Variation with respect to $A_{\mu}$ gives $\partial_{\nu} F^{\nu\mu} = J^{\mu}$, enforcing gauge-invariant field equations.

## Gauge Symmetry and Noether Current
**Conserved current:**

$$J^{\mu} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_{\mu} \phi)} \delta \phi$$

- Continuous symmetries (e.g., global phase shifts) yield conserved currents, connecting gauge variations to charge conservation.
