# G1 Single Particle Variations Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Single-particle variations illustrate how the Euler–Lagrange machinery reproduces familiar kinematics under constraints.

## Mechanics Tutorials
* *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Thornton & Marion. Provides multiplier-based constraint examples.
* *Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics* — Calkin. Walks through energy integrals and single-particle variations in detail.

## Constraint Mechanics
* *Classical Mechanics* — Goldstein, Poole, & Safko. Explains holonomic constraints and generalized forces thoroughly.
* *Analytical Mechanics* — Grant R. Fowles & George L. Cassiday. Includes numerous worked problems on constrained single-particle motion.
