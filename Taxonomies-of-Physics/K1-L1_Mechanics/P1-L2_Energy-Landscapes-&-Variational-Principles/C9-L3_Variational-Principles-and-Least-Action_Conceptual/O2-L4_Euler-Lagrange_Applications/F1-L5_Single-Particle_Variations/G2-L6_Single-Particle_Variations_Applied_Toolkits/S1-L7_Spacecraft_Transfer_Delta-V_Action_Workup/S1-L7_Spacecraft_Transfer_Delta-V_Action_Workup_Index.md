# S1-L7_Spacecraft_Transfer_Delta-V_Action_Workup — Species Index
**Definition:** Mission design worksheet that uses action methods to size burns for interplanetary transfers.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Planners set up the action integral with gravity assists, iterate candidate paths, and read off delta-v that minimizes propellant.
- The sheet contrasts patched-conic shortcuts with full action solutions to flag when simplifications break mission margins.
