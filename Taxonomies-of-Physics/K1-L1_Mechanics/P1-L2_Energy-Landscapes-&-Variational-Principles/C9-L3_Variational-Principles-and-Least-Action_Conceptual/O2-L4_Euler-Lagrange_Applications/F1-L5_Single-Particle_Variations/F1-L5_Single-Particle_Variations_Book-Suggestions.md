# F1 Single-Particle Variations — Book Suggestions

These texts provide accessible examples of applying Euler–Lagrange equations to single-particle systems.

## Introductory Treatments
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Offers many worked examples using the action principle for single particles.
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Grant R. Fowles & George L. Cassiday. Presents variational derivations of particle motion.

## Problem Collections
- *Problems and Solutions in Classical Mechanics* — Ioan Merches & Daniela Stancu. Contains exercises focused on Euler–Lagrange methods.
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Stephen T. Thornton & Jerry B. Marion. Provides solved problems for single-particle applications.

## Conceptual Extensions
- *Mechanics* — Symon. Bridges Newtonian intuition with action-based formulations.
- *A Student’s Guide to Lagrangians and Hamiltonians* — Patrick Hamill. Clarifies variations for simple systems with step-by-step derivations.
