# F2 Field and Continuum Actions — Book Suggestions

These titles extend variational principles to continua and field theories relevant to mechanics.

## Field Theory Foundations
- *Classical Field Theory* — Francis E. Low. Provides Lagrangian density derivations for scalar, electromagnetic, and elastic fields.
- *The Variational Principles of Mechanics* — Cornelius Lanczos. Covers continuum extensions of Hamilton’s principle.

## Continuum Mechanics
- *Nonlinear Continuum Mechanics for Finite Elasticity* — Y. C. Fung. Presents variational formulations of elastic solids.
- *Mathematical Theory of Elasticity* — I. S. Sokolnikoff. Includes action-based derivations of elasticity equations.

## Applied Physics Examples
- *Field Theories of Condensed Matter Physics* — Eduardo Fradkin. Applies action functionals to order parameters and defects.
