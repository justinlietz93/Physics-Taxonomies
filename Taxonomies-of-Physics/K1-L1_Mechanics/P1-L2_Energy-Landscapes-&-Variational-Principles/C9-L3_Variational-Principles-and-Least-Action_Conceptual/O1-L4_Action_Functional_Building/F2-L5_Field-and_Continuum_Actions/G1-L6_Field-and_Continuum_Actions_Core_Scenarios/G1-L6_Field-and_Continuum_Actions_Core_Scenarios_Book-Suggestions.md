# G1 Field and Continuum Actions Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Field actions extend least-action principles to distributed systems such as strings and elastic media.

## Field Theory Primers
* *Classical Field Theory* — Davydov. Introduces Lagrangian densities and field Euler–Lagrange equations with mechanical analogs.
* *Classical Electrodynamics* — Jackson. Demonstrates stress–energy tensors and conservation laws for electromagnetic fields.

## Continuum Mechanics
* *Mechanics of Continuous Media* — Malvern. Presents variational formulations for elastic and fluid continua.
* *Variational Methods in Elasticity and Plasticity* — Shield. Applies field-action approaches to structural components.
