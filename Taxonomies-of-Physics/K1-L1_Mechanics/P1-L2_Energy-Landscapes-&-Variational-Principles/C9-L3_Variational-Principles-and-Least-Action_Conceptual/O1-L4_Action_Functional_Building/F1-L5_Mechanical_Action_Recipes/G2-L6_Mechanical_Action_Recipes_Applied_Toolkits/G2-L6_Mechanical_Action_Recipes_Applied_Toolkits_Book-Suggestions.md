# G2 Mechanical Action Recipes Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Applied action toolkits translate variational recipes into computational steps and alternative formulations.

## Numerical Variational Methods
* *Geometric Numerical Integration* — Hairer, Lubich, & Wanner. Covers discrete Lagrangians and symplectic schemes.
* *Variational Integrators and Applications* — Marsden & West. Provides engineering-focused examples of discrete action design.

## Hamiltonian Transforms
