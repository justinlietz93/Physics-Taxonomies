# G1 Mechanical Action Recipes Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Core action recipes walk through how to build the Lagrangian and derive motion from variational principles.

## Variational Mechanics
* *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Provides step-by-step derivations of action integrals for standard systems.
* *Analytical Mechanics* — Fowles & Cassiday. Offers worked Euler–Lagrange examples with boundary discussions.

## Conceptual Overviews
* *The Variational Principles of Mechanics* — Cornelius Lanczos. Explains historical context and intuitive interpretations of the action.
* *Mechanics* — Landau & Lifshitz. Presents concise derivations emphasizing boundary conditions and conservation laws.
