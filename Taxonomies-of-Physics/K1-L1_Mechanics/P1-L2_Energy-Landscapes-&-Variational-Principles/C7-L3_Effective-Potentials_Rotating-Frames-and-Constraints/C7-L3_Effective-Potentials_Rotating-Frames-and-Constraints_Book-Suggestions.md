# C7 Effective Potentials, Rotating Frames & Constraints — Book Suggestions

Effective potentials fold centrifugal, Coriolis, and constraint energies into a landscape so the motion looks conservative again. These texts illustrate how to recast complicated coordinate choices into usable wells and ridges.

## Core Mechanics References
- *Mechanics* — L. D. Landau & E. M. Lifshitz. Introduces reduced masses, rotating reference frames, and effective potentials for orbital and pendular problems.
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Walks through effective potential diagrams for central forces, rotating buckets, and bead-on-wire constraints.

## Rotating & Noninertial Frames
- *Dynamics: Engineering Mechanics* — R. C. Hibbeler. Provides practical treatments of Coriolis and centrifugal terms in rotating machinery and vehicles.
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven Strogatz. Explains pendulum-in-rotating-frame and driven systems where effective potentials reveal stability islands.

## Constraints & Reduced Coordinates
- *Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics* — V. I. Arnol'd. Develops generalized coordinates, holonomic constraints, and Routhian reduction underpinning effective potential construction.
- *Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics* — M. G. Calkin. Details how to eliminate cyclic coordinates and encode constraint forces, yielding clean reduced landscapes.
