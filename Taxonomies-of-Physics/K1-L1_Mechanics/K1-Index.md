# L1. Mechanics (things that move and push)

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## L2. Phyla (big buckets inside Mechanics)

- **Particles & Rigid Bodies** — points and solid objects that translate/rotate.
- **Statics & Stability** — balance, load paths, buckling, failure.
- **Energy Landscapes & Variational Principles** — where “downhill” lives; least-action viewpoint.
- **Oscillations & Resonance** — wiggles, timing, amplification.
- **Rotations & Angular Momentum** — gyros, tops, precession, rolling.
- **Continuum Mechanics (Solids)** — elasticity, bending, fracture (fluids live in their own kingdom).
- **Mechanical Waves** — strings, beams, plates (bridges to the Waves kingdom).
- **Friction, Contact & Impact** — stick–slip, rolling vs sliding, collisions.
- **Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos** — sensitive dependence, strange attractors.

> Use 3–5 phyla per study pass; the rest wait patiently.
