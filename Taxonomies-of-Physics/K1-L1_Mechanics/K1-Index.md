# K1–L1 Mechanics (things that move and push)
**Definition:** Motions, forces, and energy trades for objects from single particles to complex machines. We watch who pushes, how resistance answers, and where “downhill” sits in the energy landscape.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phyla (L2) — index
- **P1-L2_Energy-Landscapes-&-Variational-Principles** — terrains that show where motion rests, escapes, or oscillates.
- **P2-L2_Particles-&-Rigid-Bodies** — tracking forces, momentum, and rotations for solid chunks and point masses.
- **P3-L2_Oscillations-&-Resonance** — timing, damping, and amplification when systems wiggle.
- **P4-L2_Nonlinear-Dynamics-&-Chaos** — feedbacks that create sensitivity, attractors, and complex timing.
- **P5-L2_Friction-Contact-&-Impact** — rubbing, sticking, slipping, and collisions that burn or redirect energy.
- **P6-L2_Continuum-Mechanics-(Solids)** — deformable bodies, stress paths, and failure in beams, plates, and shells.
- **P7-L2_Mechanical-Waves** — disturbances that travel through solids and strings, tying to Wave kingdom bridges.
- **P8-L2_Rotations-&-Angular-Momentum** — spinning bodies, gyros, and rolling contact that store orientation memory.

## Native questions
- What pushes or resists the motion?
- Where is the energy downhill and how deep is the basin?
- Which idealizations (point mass, rigid body, frictionless) make the story tractable?

## Everyday anchors
- Biking uphill then coasting down.
- Door closers and pogo sticks for oscillations.
- Skaters pulling arms in to spin faster.
