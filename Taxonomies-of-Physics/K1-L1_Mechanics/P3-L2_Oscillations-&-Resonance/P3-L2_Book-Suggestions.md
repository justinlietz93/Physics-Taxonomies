# P3 Oscillations & Resonance — Book Suggestions

These books frame oscillatory behavior from basic vibrations to coupled resonant systems, blending analytic solutions, physical intuition, and real-world applications.

## Vibrations Foundations
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — S.S. Rao. Comprehensive coverage of single and multi-degree oscillators, damping models, and resonance maps.
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Conceptual bridge linking simple oscillators to wave behavior with accessible derivations.

## Coupled & Nonlinear Dynamics
- *Theory of Vibrations with Applications* — William T. Thomson & Marie Dillon Dahleh. Introduces modal analysis, forced response, and vibration control strategies.
- *Nonlinear Oscillations, Dynamical Systems, and Bifurcations* — John Guckenheimer & Philip Holmes. Explores nonlinear oscillators, limit cycles, and resonance tongues.

## Experimental & Engineering Perspectives
- *Structural Dynamics: Theory and Computation* — Mario Paz & William Leigh. Focuses on numerical mode extraction and resonance management in built structures.
- *Resonant MEMS: Fundamentals, Implementation, and Application* — Oliver Brand et al. Showcases micro-scale oscillators, frequency tuning, and sensing technologies.
