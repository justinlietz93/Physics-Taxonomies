# C1 Simple & Driven Oscillators — Book Suggestions

From pendulums to RLC circuits, simple oscillators teach how restoring forces and damping sculpt motion. These books bridge analytic solutions, phasor views, and experimental examples.

## Foundational Treatments
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Introduces the harmonic oscillator, resonance, and phasor constructions with accessible derivations.
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — S. S. Rao. Covers free, damped, and forced responses with tables and plots tailored to engineering oscillator design.

## Driven Dynamics
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein, Charles Poole & John Safko. Derives Green's function and complex amplitude methods that make steady-state driving solutions transparent.
- *Vibration and Waves* — George C. King. Highlights resonance curves, quality factors, and transient decay with laboratory-focused case studies.

## Experimental & Numerical Views
- *Practical Electronics for Inventors* — Paul Scherz & Simon Monk. Applies driven oscillator ideas to RLC circuits, filters, and sensor tuning.
- *Nonlinear Oscillations* — Ali H. Nayfeh & Dean T. Mook. Previews perturbation tools and bifurcations so students see where simple oscillator intuition starts to bend.
