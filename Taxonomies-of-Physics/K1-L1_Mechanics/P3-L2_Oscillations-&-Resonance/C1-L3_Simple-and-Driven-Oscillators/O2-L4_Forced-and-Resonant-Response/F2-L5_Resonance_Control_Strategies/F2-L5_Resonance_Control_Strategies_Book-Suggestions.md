# F2 Resonance Control Strategies — Book Suggestions

These books collect passive and active techniques for taming resonance, ideal for vibration control projects in vehicles, buildings, and precision instruments.

## Passive Mitigation and Tuned Absorbers
- *Vibration Damping, Control, and Design* — Clarence W. de Silva. Surveys tuned mass dampers, viscoelastic treatments, and isolation mounts with worked design examples.
- *Practical Vibration Control* — Derek J. Inman. Focuses on absorber sizing, detuning tactics, and real-world case studies from civil and aerospace engineering.

## Active and Semi-Active Control
- *Active and Passive Vibration Control of Structures* — Indra Vir Singh & Vaibhav Baghel. Details velocity and acceleration feedback laws for beam and plate systems.
- *Smart Structures: Analysis and Design* — Aurelio L. Araujo & Manuel F. Silva. Discusses semi-active dampers, piezoelectric shunts, and adaptive suppression approaches.

## Monitoring and Implementation Guides
- *Handbook of Structural Vibration and Sound* — Thomas Rossing. Provides reference tables for transmissibility, damping ratios, and vibration isolation hardware.
- *Vibration Control Engineering* — Norman S. Currey. Combines theoretical sizing with manufacturing considerations for resonant suppression hardware.
