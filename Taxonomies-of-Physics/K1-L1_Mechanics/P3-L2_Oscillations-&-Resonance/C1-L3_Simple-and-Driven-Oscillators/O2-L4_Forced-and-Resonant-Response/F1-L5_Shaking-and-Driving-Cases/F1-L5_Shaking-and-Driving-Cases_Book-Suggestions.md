# F1 Shaking and Driving Cases — Book Suggestions

These references equip students with shaker-table know-how, covering forced vibration theory, instrumentation, and lab-scale case studies.

## Analytical Playbooks
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Provides full treatments of steady-state and transient responses for various forcing waveforms.
- *Engineering Vibration* — Daniel J. Inman. Highlights resonance curves, phase measurements, and parameter identification from frequency sweeps.

## Laboratory and Application Guides
- *Vibration Testing and Measurement* — Kim H. H. Tan & Li T. Wang. Offers shaker setup advice, sensor selection, and data acquisition examples for drive-response experiments.
- *Experimental Modal Analysis* — Ewins D. J. Shows how driven tests yield modal properties, including shaker placement and force calibration tips.

## Control and Mitigation Resources
- *Active Control of Vibration* — Christopher Fuller, Sharon Elliott, & P. A. Nelson. Connects forced vibration theory to active cancellation strategies.
- *Random Vibrations: Theory and Practice* — Paul H. Wirsching, Thomas L. Paez, & Keith Ortiz. Extends sinusoidal forcing to random drives, preparing students for broadband shaker campaigns.
