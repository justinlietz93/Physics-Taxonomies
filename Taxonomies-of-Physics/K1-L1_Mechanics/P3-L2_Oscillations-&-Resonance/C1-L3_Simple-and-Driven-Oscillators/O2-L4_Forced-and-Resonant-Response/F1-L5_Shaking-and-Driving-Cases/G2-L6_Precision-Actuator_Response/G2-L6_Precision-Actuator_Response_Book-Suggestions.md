# G2 Precision Actuator Response — Book Suggestions

These books guide engineers modeling resonance in precision motion systems.

## Control-Oriented References
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Franklin, Powell, Emami-Naeini. Provides second-order response metrics and resonance management strategies.
- *Precision Machine Design* — Alexander H. Slocum. Links actuator dynamics to mechanical design choices and settling time targets.

## Vibration Suppression Techniques
- *Vibration Control of Active Structures* — Preumont. Discusses resonant gain, damping augmentation, and active control approaches for precision stages.
- *Nanopositioning Technologies* — Andrey B. Savchenko. Details performance metrics, command shaping, and resonance avoidance for piezo stages.

## Testing and Metrology
- *Experimental Modal Analysis* — Ewins. Offers techniques for measuring $\omega_n$, $\zeta$, and validating actuator transfer functions.
