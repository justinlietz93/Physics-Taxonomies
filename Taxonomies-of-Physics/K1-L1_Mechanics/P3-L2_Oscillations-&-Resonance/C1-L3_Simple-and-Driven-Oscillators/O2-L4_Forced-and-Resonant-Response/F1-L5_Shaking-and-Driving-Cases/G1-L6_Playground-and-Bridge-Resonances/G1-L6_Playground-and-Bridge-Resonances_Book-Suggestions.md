# G1 Playground and Bridge Resonances — Book Suggestions

These resources translate resonance theory into real swings, footbridges, and crowd dynamics.

## Popular Accounts of Resonance
- *Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down* — J.E. Gordon. Uses bridges and playground examples to explain resonance intuitively.
- *Swing Like a Pro* — Jim Moore. Focuses on timing and energy transfer when pumping playground swings.

## Engineering Case Studies
- *Dynamics of Structures* — Anil K. Chopra. Provides analyses of pedestrian bridge resonances and damping strategies.
- *Human-Induced Vibration of Footbridges* — Bruno Bruni. Details design guidelines and measured crowd forcing spectra.

## Safety and Design Manuals
- *Guide for the Design of Footbridges* — AASHTO. Includes vibration limits and damping recommendations grounded in the equations above.
