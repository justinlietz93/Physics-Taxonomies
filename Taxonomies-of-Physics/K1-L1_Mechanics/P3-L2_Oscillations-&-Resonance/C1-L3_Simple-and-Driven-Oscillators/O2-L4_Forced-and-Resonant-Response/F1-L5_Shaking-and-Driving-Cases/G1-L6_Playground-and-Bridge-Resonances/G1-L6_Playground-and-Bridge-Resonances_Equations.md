# G1 Playground and Bridge Resonances â€” Core Equations

Resonance explains why swings pump higher and bridges can wobble. These equations describe driven oscillator amplitude, phase, and energy transfer relevant to playgrounds and pedestrian bridges.

## Steady-State Amplitude of a Driven Oscillator
**Shows growth near resonance.**

$$A(\omega) = \frac{F_0/m}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (2\zeta \omega_0 \omega)^2}}$$

- Driving frequency $\omega$ near natural frequency $\omega_0$ produces large amplitudes; damping ratio $\zeta$ controls peak height.

## Phase Lag Between Driver and Response
**Explains timing cues for pumping a swing.**

$$\tan \phi = \frac{2\zeta \omega_0 \omega}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}$$

- Phase lag $\phi$ transitions from $0$ to $\pi$ as driving frequency crosses resonance, guiding riders on when to shift weight for maximal energy input.

## Power Absorbed at Resonance
**Quantifies energy delivered per cycle.**

$$P_{\text{avg}} = \tfrac{1}{2} c \omega^2 A^2$$

- With damping coefficient $c = 2 m \zeta \omega_0$, the absorbed power peaks at resonance, highlighting why bridges need tuned damping to manage crowd forcing.
