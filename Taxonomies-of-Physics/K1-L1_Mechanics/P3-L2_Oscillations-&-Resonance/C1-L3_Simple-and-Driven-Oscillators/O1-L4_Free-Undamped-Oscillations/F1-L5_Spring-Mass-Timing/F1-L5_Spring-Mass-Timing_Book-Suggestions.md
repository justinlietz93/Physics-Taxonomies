# F1 Spring Mass Timing — Book Suggestions

These resources help lab teams tune simple oscillators so that period measurements remain trustworthy, covering calibration practices, uncertainty analysis, and classroom experiments built around mass–spring timers.

## Lab Manuals and Experiment Guides
- *Vibrations and Waves in Physics* — Iain G. Main. Provides detailed timing experiments for springs and pendula with guidance on reducing friction and reading oscillation periods accurately.
- *Physics by Inquiry, Volume II* — Lillian C. McDermott et al. Walks instructors through constructing and assessing mass–spring timing activities for introductory laboratories.

## Measurement and Uncertainty References
- *An Introduction to Error Analysis* — John R. Taylor. Lays out propagation of timing and mass uncertainties, ideal for estimating stiffness tolerances in oscillator calibrations.
- *Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Philip R. Bevington & D. Keith Robinson. Supplies regression strategies for extracting $k$ and $m_{\text{eff}}$ from timing data sets.

## Design and Optimization Texts
- *Experimental Techniques in Vibrations* — J. W. Mitchell & S. J. Rothberg. Discusses sensor placement, trigger timing, and damping mitigation when building repeatable oscillation rigs.
- *Classical Mechanics: Systems of Particles and Hamiltonian Dynamics* — Walter Greiner. Connects the theory of harmonic oscillators to practical parameter identification so that design tweaks stay predictive.
