# G2 Pendulum Period Checks — Book Suggestions

These books support accurate pendulum timing exercises in classrooms and field settings.

## Pendulum Physics and History
- *The Pendulum: A Case Study in Physics* — Gregory L. Baker. Explores period corrections, damping, and measurement methods.
- *The Shortest History of the Pendulum* — John Heilbron. Provides historical context for pendulum timing as a measurement standard.

## Laboratory Resources
- *Advanced Physics Experiments* — Harcourt Brown. Features pendulum labs with uncertainty analysis tied to the equations above.
- *Physics Experiment Manual* — Charles Taylor. Offers guidelines on timing techniques and amplitude corrections.

## Timekeeping and Calibration
- *Precision Pendulum Clocks* — Derek Roberts. Discusses how clockmakers manage length tolerances and environmental effects, echoing the uncertainty relation used here.
