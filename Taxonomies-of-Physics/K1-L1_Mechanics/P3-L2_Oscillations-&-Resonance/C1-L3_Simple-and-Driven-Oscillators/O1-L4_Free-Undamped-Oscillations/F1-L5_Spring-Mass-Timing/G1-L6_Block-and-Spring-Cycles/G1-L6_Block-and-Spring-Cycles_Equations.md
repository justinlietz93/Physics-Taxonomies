# G1 Block and Spring Cycles — Core Equations

Ideal spring–mass oscillators set the baseline for timing labs. These equations capture period, energy exchange, and phase relationships for frictionless block-and-spring motion.

## Natural Frequency and Period
**Determines oscillation timing.**

$$\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \qquad T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_0}$$

- With spring constant $k$ and mass $m$, the angular frequency $\omega_0$ and period $T$ govern how long each cycle lasts regardless of amplitude.

## Displacement as a Function of Time
**Provides the template waveform.**

$$x(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t + \phi)$$

- Amplitude $A$ and phase $\phi$ set initial conditions, while $\omega_0$ fixes the oscillation speed, letting students predict positions at any time.

## Energy Partition During Motion
**Shows continual exchange between kinetic and potential forms.**

$$E = \tfrac{1}{2} k x^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 = \tfrac{1}{2} k A^2$$

- Total energy stays constant; potential energy peaks at turning points and kinetic energy peaks at equilibrium, reinforcing conservation principles.
