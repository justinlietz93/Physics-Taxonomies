# O1 Free Undamped Oscillations — Book Suggestions

These selections build intuition for frictionless oscillators where energy sloshes perfectly between kinetic and potential forms. Each title keeps the math transparent so students can map theory to everyday springs, pendula, and torsion rigs.

## Intuitive Foundations
- *An Introduction to Mechanics* — Daniel Kleppner & Robert Kolenkow. Derives the simple harmonic oscillator from Newton’s laws with clear examples that set up later driven and damped cases.
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Uses pendula and masses on springs to illustrate phase, amplitude, and energy exchange before complications like damping appear.

## Calculation Playbooks
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor. Walks through solving the undamped oscillator in Cartesian and angular coordinates, reinforcing phase-space pictures and energy invariants.
- *Mechanics* — L.D. Landau & E.M. Lifshitz. Highlights the Lagrangian route to the harmonic oscillator and shows why the solution recurs across physics.

## Experiments and Visual Demos
- *Practical Physics: Handbooks for Physics Experiments* — William F. Ganong. Provides lab setups for measuring natural periods and validating energy conservation in near-frictionless systems.
- *The Amateur Scientist* — C.L. Stong. Offers do-it-yourself demonstrations that keep oscillations undamped long enough to see phase relations and period scaling in action.
