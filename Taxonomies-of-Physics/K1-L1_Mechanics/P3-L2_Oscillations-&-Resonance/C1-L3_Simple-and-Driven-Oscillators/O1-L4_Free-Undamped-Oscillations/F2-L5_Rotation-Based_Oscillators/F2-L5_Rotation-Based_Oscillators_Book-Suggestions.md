# F2 Rotation Based Oscillators — Book Suggestions

These texts support teams balancing torsion pendula, gyroscopic timers, and other rotary oscillators by combining theory, instrumentation, and application case studies.

## Foundational Mechanics
- *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* — Jerry B. Marion & Stephen T. Thornton. Derives torsion pendulum motion and small-angle approximations that underpin rotary timing rigs.
- *Analytical Mechanics* — Louis N. Hand & Janet D. Finch. Uses Lagrangian methods to generalize rotational oscillators with distributed inertia and constraints.

## Measurement and Metrology Resources
- *Mechanical Measurements* — S. P. Venkateshan & Prasanna Swaminathan. Details angular displacement sensors, torsion balance calibrations, and data reduction workflows.
- *Precision Measurement and Calibration: Mechanical Measuring Instruments* — National Bureau of Standards. Offers procedures for certifying torsional stiffness and rotational inertias.

## Application Case Studies
- *Gyroscope Theory, Design, and Instrumentation* — Anastasios I. D. Avranas. Connects torsion oscillators to gyroscopic suspensions and balance tuning strategies.
- *The Foucault Pendulum* — Tony Buxton. Provides historical and experimental perspectives on long-period rotational pendula that sharpen timing insight for modern builds.
