# G1 Flywheel Balance Cycles â€” Core Equations

Flywheels with small imbalance behave as torsional oscillators. These equations relate mass eccentricity to vibration amplitude, angular frequency, and energy storage during balance checks.

## Angular Frequency of Small Oscillations
**Determines wobble rate.**

$$\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k_\theta}{I}}$$

- Torsional stiffness $k_\theta$ of the support and the flywheel inertia $I$ set the small-angle oscillation frequency when a rotor is flexibly mounted.

## Displacement Amplitude from Imbalance
**Links eccentric mass to angular deflection.**

$$\theta_{\text{max}} = \frac{m_e r_e g}{k_\theta}$$

- An eccentric mass $m_e$ at radius $r_e$ produces a static torque $m_e r_e g$, leading to an angular offset $\theta_{\text{max}}$ that technicians measure to correct balance.

## Stored Rotational Energy
**Checks energy variation during oscillation.**

$$E = \tfrac{1}{2} I \omega^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} k_\theta \theta^2$$

- Rotational kinetic energy plus torsional potential stays constant in the undamped case, highlighting how imbalance energy sloshes between rotation and support twist.
