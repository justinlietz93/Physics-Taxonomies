# G2 Torsion Oscillator Sketches â€” Core Equations

Torsion oscillators twist wires instead of stretching springs. These equations support sketching angular displacement, period, and energy behavior for wire-based oscillators.

## Period of a Torsion Pendulum
**Relates wire stiffness to oscillation time.**

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{I}{\kappa}}$$

- Here $I$ is the moment of inertia of the suspended object and $\kappa$ is the torsion constant of the wire, dictating the timing of angular oscillations.

## Angular Displacement Over Time
**Provides sinusoidal twist profiles.**

$$\theta(t) = \Theta_0 \cos(\omega t + \phi), \qquad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{\kappa}{I}}$$

- Angular amplitude $\Theta_0$ and phase $\phi$ shape the oscillation trace, while $\omega$ matches the frequency derived from the period formula.

## Maximum Shear Stress in the Wire
**Checks material limits during twisting.**

$$\tau_{\text{max}} = \frac{T r}{J}$$

- Torque $T = \kappa \Theta_0$ applied to a wire of radius $r$ and polar moment $J$ sets peak shear stress, ensuring the oscillator stays within elastic limits.
