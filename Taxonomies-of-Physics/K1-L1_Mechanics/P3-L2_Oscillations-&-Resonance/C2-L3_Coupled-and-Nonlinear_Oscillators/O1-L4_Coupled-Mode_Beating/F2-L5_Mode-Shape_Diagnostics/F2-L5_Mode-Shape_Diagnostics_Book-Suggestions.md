# F2 Mode Shape Diagnostics — Book Suggestions

These references emphasize experimental modal analysis and signal processing techniques for identifying coupled-mode shapes and participation factors.

## Modal Analysis Foundations
- *Modal Testing: Theory, Practice and Application* — D. J. Ewins. Comprehensive guide to extracting mode shapes, damping, and frequency splits from vibration data.
- *Operational Modal Analysis* — Peter Andersen & Henrik Herlufsen. Focuses on ambient excitation methods relevant to lightly driven beat measurements.

## Signal Processing and Identification
- *Time Series Analysis* — Jonathan D. Cryer & Kung-Sik Chan. Provides tools for fitting modal coordinates and separating close frequency components in beating signals.
- *Structural Dynamics: An Introduction to Computer Methods* — Roy R. Craig Jr. & Andrew J. Kurdila. Discusses computational extraction of eigenvectors from measured FRFs.

## Advanced Diagnostics and Case Studies
- *Experimental Techniques for Engineers* — J. P. Holman. Covers instrumentation, sensor placement, and calibration strategies for accurate mode-shape capture.
- *Handbook of Experimental Structural Mechanics* — Gary S. Schajer. Presents real-world case studies on mode-shape diagnostics in aerospace and civil structures.
