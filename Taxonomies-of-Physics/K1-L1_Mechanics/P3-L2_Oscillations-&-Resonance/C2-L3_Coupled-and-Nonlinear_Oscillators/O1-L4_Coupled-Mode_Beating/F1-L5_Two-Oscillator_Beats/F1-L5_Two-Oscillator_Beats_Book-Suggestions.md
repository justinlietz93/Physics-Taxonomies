# F1 Two Oscillator Beats — Book Suggestions

These texts help learners interpret coupled-oscillator beats, from introductory demonstrations to quantitative modal analysis.

## Conceptual Primers
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A. P. French. Introduces beating with accessible experiments using pendula and tuning forks.
- *The Physics of Vibrations and Waves* — H. J. Pain. Discusses energy exchange and coupled-mode interpretations for undergraduate readers.

## Quantitative Treatments
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein, Charles Poole, & John Safko. Develops normal-mode analysis for weakly coupled oscillators.
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Rao Singiresu S. Provides detailed derivations and design formulas for two-degree-of-freedom systems producing beats.

## Experimental References
- *Experimental Modal Analysis* — Ewins D. J. Demonstrates how to excite and measure coupled modes in lab hardware using modern instrumentation.
- *Teaching Introductory Physics* — Arnold B. Arons. Shares classroom-tested activities for demonstrating beating phenomena clearly.
