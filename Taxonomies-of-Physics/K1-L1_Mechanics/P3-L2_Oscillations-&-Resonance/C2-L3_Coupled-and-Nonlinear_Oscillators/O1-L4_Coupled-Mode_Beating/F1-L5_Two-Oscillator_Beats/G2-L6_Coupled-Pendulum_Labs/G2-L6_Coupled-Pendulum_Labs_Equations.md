# G2 Coupled Pendulum Labs â€” Core Equations

Coupled pendulums visualize energy swapping and mode shapes. These equations capture mode frequencies, beat periods, and coupling strength estimates for lab write-ups.

## Mode Frequencies for Weak Coupling
**Approximate angular frequencies.**

$$\omega_{\pm} \approx \omega_0 \sqrt{1 \pm \kappa}$$

- With base frequency $\omega_0$ and small coupling coefficient $\kappa$, the symmetric mode (minus) is slightly slower, the antisymmetric mode (plus) slightly faster.

## Beat Period Between Pendulums
**Determines energy transfer cycle.**

$$T_{\text{beat}} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_+ - \omega_-} \approx \frac{\pi}{\omega_0 \kappa}$$

- Students compare measured envelope periods to this expression to infer coupling strength.

## Coupling Coefficient from String Tension
**Relates physical linkage to \(\kappa\).**

$$\kappa = \frac{k_c}{2m g / L}$$

- For small-angle pendulums of length $L$ and mass $m$ tied by spring constant $k_c$, this ratio estimates the dimensionless coupling parameter.
