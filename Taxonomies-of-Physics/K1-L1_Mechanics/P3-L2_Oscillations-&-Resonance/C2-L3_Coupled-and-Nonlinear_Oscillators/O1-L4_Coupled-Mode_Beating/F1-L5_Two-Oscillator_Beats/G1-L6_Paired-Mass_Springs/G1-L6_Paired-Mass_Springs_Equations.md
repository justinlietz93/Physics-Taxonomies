# G1 Paired Mass Springs â€” Core Equations

Two masses coupled by springs display normal modes and beats. These equations quantify mode frequencies, superposition, and energy exchange for introductory coupled-oscillator demos.

## Normal Mode Frequencies
**Solve eigenvalue problem for two masses.**

$$\omega_{\pm} = \sqrt{\frac{k + k_c \pm k_c}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{k + k_c(1 \pm 1)}{m}}$$

- With identical masses $m$ and end springs $k$ coupled by spring $k_c$, the lower mode uses in-phase motion ($-$), the higher uses out-of-phase motion ($+$).

## General Solution as Mode Superposition
**Describes beating between modes.**

$$x_1(t) = A_- \cos(\omega_- t) + A_+ \cos(\omega_+ t)$$

- Different amplitudes $A_\pm$ set beat envelopes; energy transfers between masses as the two modes interfere.

## Beat Frequency
**Predicts envelope oscillation rate.**

$$f_{\text{beat}} = \frac{\omega_+ - \omega_-}{2\pi}$$

- The difference in mode frequencies controls how fast energy sloshes between masses, aligning with observed slow pulsations in labs.
