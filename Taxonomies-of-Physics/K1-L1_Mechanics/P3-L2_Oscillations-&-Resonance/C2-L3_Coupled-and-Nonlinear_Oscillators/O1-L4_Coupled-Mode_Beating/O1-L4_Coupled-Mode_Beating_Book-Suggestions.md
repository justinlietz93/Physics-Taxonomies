# O1 Coupled-Mode Beating — Book Suggestions

When oscillators share a weak linkage, their normal modes split and slow energy swaps appear. These references build the intuition and calculation skills needed to predict beating envelopes and diagnose coupling strength.

## Conceptual Bridges
- *Vibrations and Waves in Physics* — Iain G. Main. Uses coupled pendula and strings to show how small frequency splittings generate beat patterns and nodal shifts.
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein, Charles P. Poole Jr., & John L. Safko. Derives coupled normal modes from the Lagrangian perspective with matrix methods that generalize beyond two oscillators.

## Engineering and Experimental Guides
- *Mechanical and Structural Vibrations* — Jerry H. Ginsberg. Provides laboratory-scale examples of energy exchange in coupled beams and plates, complete with measurement strategies.
- *Principles of Vibration* — Benson H. Tongue. Offers computational recipes for extracting coupling constants and visualizing mode shapes in multi-degree-of-freedom systems.

## Molecular and Lattice Applications
- *Molecular Vibrations* — E. Bright Wilson Jr., J.C. Decius, & Paul C. Cross. Connects the mathematics of coupled oscillators to vibrational spectroscopy and energy transfer between bonded atoms.
- *Introduction to Solid State Physics* — Charles Kittel. Highlights phonon mode splitting in diatomic chains, giving a condensed-matter context for the beating behavior described at this order.
