# O2-L4_Parametric-and_Limit-Cycles — Order Index
**Definition:** Looks at oscillators whose parameters vary with time or whose nonlinearity sustains oscillation.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Parametric_Excitation_Cases** — Driving stiffness or length to pump energy into oscillations.
- **F2-L5_Nonlinear_Limit-Cycle_Toolkits** — Systems that settle into self-sustained oscillations.
