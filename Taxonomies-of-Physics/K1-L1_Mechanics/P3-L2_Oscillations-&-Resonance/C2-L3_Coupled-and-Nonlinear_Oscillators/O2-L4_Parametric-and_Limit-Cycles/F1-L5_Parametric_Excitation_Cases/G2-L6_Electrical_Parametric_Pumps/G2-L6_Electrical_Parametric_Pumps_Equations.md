# G2 Electrical Parametric Pumps â€” Core Equations

Parametric amplifiers use time-varying circuit elements to transfer energy between frequencies. These equations describe pump frequency selection, gain, and phase relationships for mechanical analogies.

## Pump Frequency Matching Condition
**Ensures energy transfer to signal frequency.**

$$\omega_p \approx \omega_s + \omega_i$$

- Pump frequency $\omega_p$ equals the sum of signal $\omega_s$ and idler $\omega_i$ frequencies in non-degenerate parametric amplification.

## Small-Signal Gain Expression
**Relates modulation strength to amplitude growth.**

$$G \approx \frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{\gamma}{\gamma_c}\right)^2}$$

- Modulation depth $\gamma$ relative to critical value $\gamma_c$ sets gain $G$; approaching $\gamma_c$ yields large amplification before instability.

## Phase Matching Requirement
**Keeps pump, signal, and idler in sync.**

$$\phi_p = \phi_s + \phi_i + \pi/2$$

- Proper phase relationship maximizes energy transfer; deviations reduce gain, mirroring timing constraints in mechanical parametric pumping.
