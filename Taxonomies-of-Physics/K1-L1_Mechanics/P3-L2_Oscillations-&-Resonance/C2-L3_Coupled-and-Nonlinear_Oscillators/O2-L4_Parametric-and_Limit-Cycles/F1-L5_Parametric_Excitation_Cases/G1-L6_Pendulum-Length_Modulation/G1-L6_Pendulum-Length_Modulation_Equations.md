# G1 Pendulum Length Modulation â€” Core Equations

Parametric pumping changes pendulum length to add energy. These equations describe Mathieu-type resonance, modulation frequency, and growth rates for small oscillations.

## Parametric Excitation Condition
**Identifies resonance bands.**

$$\omega_{\text{mod}} \approx 2 \omega_0$$

- Modulating the length near twice the natural frequency $\omega_0$ triggers the primary parametric resonance that pumps amplitude.

## Mathieu Equation Form
**Models modulation as periodic coefficient.**

$$\ddot{\theta} + \left(\omega_0^2 + \epsilon \cos \omega_{\text{mod}} t\right) \theta = 0$$

- Small modulation depth $\epsilon$ captures how length oscillations perturb the effective restoring torque.

## Growth Rate in Instability Region
**Estimates exponential amplitude increase.**

$$\sigma \approx \frac{\epsilon \omega_0}{4}$$

- Within the resonance tongue, amplitude grows roughly as $e^{\sigma t}$; this guides how quickly pumping builds swing amplitude before nonlinear limits appear.
