# C2 Coupled & Nonlinear Oscillators — Book Suggestions

Coupled and nonlinear oscillators introduce mode splitting, beats, and amplitude-dependent frequencies. These texts emphasize analytical, numerical, and experimental strategies for tracking complex responses.

## Coupling Frameworks
- *Introduction to Applied Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Chaos* — Stephen Wiggins. Builds normal mode decompositions, center manifolds, and perturbative tools for weakly coupled oscillators.
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Covers matrix formulations for multi-degree systems, modal truncation, and tuning for vibration isolation.

## Nonlinear Phenomena
- *Nonlinear Oscillations* — Ali H. Nayfeh & Dean T. Mook. Introduces multiple scales, averaging, and backbone curves for Duffing, van der Pol, and parametric oscillators.
- *Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics* — Robert C. Hilborn. Places period doubling, strange attractors, and synchronization within oscillator experiments and simulations.

## Experimental & Numerical Labs
- *Synchronization: A Universal Concept in Nonlinear Sciences* — Arkady Pikovsky, Michael Rosenblum & Jürgen Kurths. Surveys phase locking and entrainment examples ranging from clocks to power grids.
- *Computational Nonlinear Mechanics* — S. N. Atluri. Discusses time-integration and continuation methods that track response branches of nonlinear oscillators.
