# Measurement, Signals, & Control (how we know & steer)

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phylum

- **Sensing & Instrumentation** — detectors, transducers; *thermometers, photodiodes*.
- **Signal Representations** — time/frequency, sampling; *music EQ intuition*.
- **Noise & Stochastic Processes** — sources, spectra; *hiss vs tone*.
- **Estimation & Filtering** — averaging smartly; *Kalman, smoothing*.
- **Feedback & Control** — stability, setpoint tracking; *thermostats, cruise control*.
- **Experiment Design & Error** — calibration, uncertainty; *lab hygiene*.
