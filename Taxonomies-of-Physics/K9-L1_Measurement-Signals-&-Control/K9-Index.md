# K9–L1 Measurement, Signals, & Control
**Definition:** Tools, models, and feedback loops that let us sense the world, clean up information, and steer systems gently toward targets.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phyla (L2) — index
- P1-L2_Sensing-&-Instrumentation — translating physical effects into trustworthy electrical or optical signals.
- P2-L2_Signal-Representations — choosing time, frequency, or code views to reveal patterns and compress meaning.
- P3-L2_Noise-&-Stochastic-Processes — tracing where randomness creeps in and how its spectrum shapes decisions.
- P4-L2_Estimation-&-Filtering — blending models with data to guess hidden states and smooth messy readings.
- P5-L2_Feedback-&-Control — designing loops that nudge systems toward setpoints without ringing or runaway.
- P6-L2_Experiment-Design-&-Error — planning measurements, tracking uncertainty, and reporting honest confidence bands.

## Native questions
- How do we turn temperature, light, and motion into electrical readouts we can trust?
- Which signal views and noise models reveal the features worth acting on?
- How do estimation and feedback close the loop while keeping error bars transparent?

## Everyday anchors
- Smart thermostats blending sensors, filtering, and control logic to keep homes comfortable.
- Noise-canceling headphones that model ambient hum and inject the right counter-signal in real time.
- Lab notebooks showing calibration curves and uncertainty budgets for every instrument setting.
