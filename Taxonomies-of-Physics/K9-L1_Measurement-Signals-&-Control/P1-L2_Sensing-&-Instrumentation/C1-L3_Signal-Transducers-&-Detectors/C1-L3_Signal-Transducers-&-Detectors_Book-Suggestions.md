# C1 Signal Transducers & Detectors — Book Suggestions

Transducers convert physical quantities into measurable electrical signals. These references examine sensing principles, detector physics, and interface design.

## Sensor Fundamentals
- *Measurement Systems: Application and Design* — Ernest O. Doebelin & Dhanesh Manik. Covers transducer models, calibration, and error analysis.
- *Sensors and Signal Conditioning* — Ramon Pallás-Areny & John G. Webster. Focuses on bridge circuits, instrumentation amplifiers, and conditioning.

## Detector Physics
- *Physics of Semiconductor Devices* — Simon M. Sze & Kwok Ng. Provides photodiode, Hall, and piezoresistive detector principles.
- *Optical Detection Theory* — H. Paul Urbach. Discusses photodetector noise and responsivity.

## Application Guides
- *Bioinstrumentation* — John D. Enderle et al. Applies transducer principles to biomedical sensing.
- *Industrial Instrumentation* — Donald P. Eckman. Surveys process sensors, transmitters, and installation practices.
