# C1-L3_Signal-Transducers-&-Detectors — Class Index
**Definition:** Matching physical phenomena with sensing elements, conditioning circuits, and packaging that preserve fidelity.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Order (L4) — index
- O1-L4_Mechanical-&-Thermal-Transducers — strain, pressure, and heat elements that convert force or temperature to voltage or resistance shifts.
- O2-L4_Electro-Optic-Detectors — photonic and electromagnetic sensors turning photons into charge or current pulses.
