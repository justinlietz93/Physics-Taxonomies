# O1 Reference Standards & Traceability — Book Suggestions

These references cover national metrology systems, uncertainty analysis, and primary standards that underpin calibration chains.

## Foundational Primers
- *Introduction to Measurement and Calibration* — L. C. Mendes. Explains traceability chains, uncertainty budgets, and calibration reports.
- *Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)* — ISO/IEC. Core reference for uncertainty propagation and coverage factors.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Metrology and Calibration* — J. F. Blackburn. Detailed discussion of primary standards, comparison campaigns, and traceability maintenance.
- *Quantum Metrology* — S. Olmschenk & M. Metcalf. Connects Josephson, quantum Hall, and optical clock standards to practical calibration.

## Applied References
- *NIST Technical Notes on Calibration Services*. Official procedures for linking instruments to national standards.
- *BIPM Key Comparison Database Guides*. Illustrate how international comparisons validate traceability chains.
