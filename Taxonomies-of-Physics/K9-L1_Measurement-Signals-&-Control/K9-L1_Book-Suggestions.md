# K9 Measurement, Signals & Control — Book Suggestions

Use these resources to build broad literacy across instrumentation, signal theory, stochastic processes, and feedback practice before diving into the phyla.

- **Taylor, *An Introduction to Error Analysis*.** Clear guidance on measurement uncertainty, propagation, and reporting that underpins experimental practice.
- **Oppenheim & Willsky, *Signals and Systems*.** Foundational treatment of time and frequency domain analysis, convolution, and sampling for continuous and discrete signals.
- **Kay, *Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing, Volume I: Estimation Theory*.** Systematic coverage of estimators, optimality criteria, and Bayesian viewpoints for data fusion.
- **Gelb (ed.), *Applied Optimal Estimation*.** Classic collection on Kalman filtering, navigation, and sensor integration that ties theory to aerospace and robotics case studies.
- **Åström & Murray, *Feedback Systems*.** Modern introduction to control theory emphasizing state-space modeling, stability, and design patterns across engineering domains.
