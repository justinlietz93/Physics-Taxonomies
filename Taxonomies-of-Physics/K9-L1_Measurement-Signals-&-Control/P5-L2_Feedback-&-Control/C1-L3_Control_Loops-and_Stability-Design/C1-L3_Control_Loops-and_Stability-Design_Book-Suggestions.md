# C1 Control Loops and Stability Design — Book Suggestions

Control loops regulate systems despite disturbances. These references cover loop shaping, stability margins, and modern control strategies.

## Classical Control
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene F. Franklin, J. David Powell & Abbas Emami-Naeini. Introduces root locus, Bode plots, and design methods.
- *Modern Control Engineering* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Comprehensive coverage of classical and state-space control.

## Robust & Loop Shaping
- *Robust and Optimal Control* — Zhou, Doyle & Glover. Explores $H_{\infty}$ methods and robustness metrics.
- *Loop Transfer Recovery* — Gregory F. Franklin et al. Discusses loop shaping and controller synthesis.

## Applications
- *Control System Design* — Graham C. Goodwin et al. Practical design case studies with digital implementation.
- *Feedback Systems* — Karl J. Åström & Richard M. Murray. Free text emphasizing feedback principles and robustness.
