# O1 Classical Compensation Toolkits — Book Suggestions

These books emphasize Bode, Nyquist, and root-locus design of classical compensators for measurement systems.

## Foundational Primers
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Franklin, Powell & Emami-Naeini. Introduces PID tuning, lead–lag design, and loop shaping.
- *Modern Control Engineering* — Katsuhiko Ogata. Provides root-locus and frequency-domain compensation strategies with worked examples.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Classical Feedback Control with MATLAB* — James Van de Vegte. Applies classical techniques using computational tools.
- *Loop-Shaping Design* — J. F. Whidborne & G. Vinnicombe. Discusses sensitivity trade-offs and robust classical compensation.

## Applied References
- *Texas Instruments Control Loop Cookbook*. Practical guidelines for analog compensator design in power electronics.
- *Analog Devices PLL and Loop Filter Design Notes*. Real-world applications of lead–lag filters in frequency control loops.
