- *Mechatronics: Electronic Control Systems in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering* — W. Bolton. Introduces sensor/actuator interfacing and control implementation.
- *Design with Operational Amplifiers and Analog Integrated Circuits* — Franco. Practical analog interface circuits for sensors and actuators.

## Real-Time Control
- *Real-Time Systems Design and Analysis* — Phillip A. Laplante. Discusses scheduling and timing constraints in control implementations.
- *Embedded Control Systems in Practice* — Wolfhard Lawo et al. Case studies on integrating hardware and software for control loops.

## Reliability & Diagnostics
