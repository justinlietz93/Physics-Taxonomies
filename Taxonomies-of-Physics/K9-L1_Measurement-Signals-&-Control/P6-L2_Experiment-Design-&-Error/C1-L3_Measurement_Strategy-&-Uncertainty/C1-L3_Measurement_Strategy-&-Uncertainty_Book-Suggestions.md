# C1 Measurement Strategy & Uncertainty — Book Suggestions

Designing experiments requires planning measurements, evaluating uncertainty, and optimizing resources. These references cover design of experiments, uncertainty budgets, and decision making.

## Experimental Design
- *Design and Analysis of Experiments* — Douglas C. Montgomery. Introduces factorial, response-surface, and robust design techniques.
- *Statistics for Experimenters* — Box, Hunter & Hunter. Practical strategies for planning and analyzing experiments.

## Uncertainty & Decision Making
- *Measurement Uncertainty* — Ronald H. Dieck. Guides creation of uncertainty budgets and risk assessments.
- *Decision Theory* — Peter D. Wakker. Provides tools for decision making under measurement uncertainty.

## Optimization & Resource Allocation
- *Optimal Experiment Design* — Atkinson, Donev & Tobias. Mathematical framework for maximizing information.
- *Bayesian Experimental Design* — Chaloner & Verdinelli. Discusses Bayesian approaches to adaptively selecting measurements.
