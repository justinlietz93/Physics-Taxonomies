# F2-L5_Wavelet_Bank_Playbooks — Family Index
**Definition:** Choosing mother wavelets, scales, and thresholding plans to highlight bursts, edges, and drifts.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Genus (L6) — index
- G1-L6_Wavelet_Family_Selection — match Daubechies, Morlet, or Haar families to data textures.
- G2-L6_Scalogram_Interpretation_Tools — read color maps to explain what bursts and ridges really mean.
## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- Power quality wavelet alarms, geophysics microquake passes, bearing fault scalogram briefs, and speech syllable stories.
