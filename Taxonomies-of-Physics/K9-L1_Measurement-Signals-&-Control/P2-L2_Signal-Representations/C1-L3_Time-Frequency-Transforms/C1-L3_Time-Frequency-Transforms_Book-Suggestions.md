# C1 Time-Frequency Transforms — Book Suggestions

Time-frequency transforms reveal how signal energy evolves over time and frequency. These references cover Fourier, wavelet, and spectrogram techniques.

## Fundamental References
- *Signals and Systems* — Alan V. Oppenheim & Alan S. Willsky. Introduces Fourier transforms, convolution, and spectral analysis.

## Wavelets & Multiresolution
- *A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing* — Stéphane Mallat. Explains discrete wavelet transforms and applications.
- *Wavelets and Subband Coding* — Vetterli & Kovacevic. Focuses on filter banks and multiresolution analysis.

## Applications
