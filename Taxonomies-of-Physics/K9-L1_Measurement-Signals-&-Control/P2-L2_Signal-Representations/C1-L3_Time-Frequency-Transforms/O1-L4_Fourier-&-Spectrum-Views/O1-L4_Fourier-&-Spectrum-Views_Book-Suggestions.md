# O1 Fourier & Spectrum Views — Book Suggestions

These titles ground readers in Fourier transforms, spectral estimation, and digital implementation for instrumentation.

## Foundational Primers
- *Signals and Systems* — Alan V. Oppenheim & Alan S. Willsky. Provides CTFT/DTFT derivations and properties with measurement examples.
- *The Fourier Transform and Its Applications* — Ronald Bracewell. Intuitive coverage of spectra, convolution, and windowing.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Discrete-Time Signal Processing* — Oppenheim & Schafer. In-depth treatment of DFT/FFT algorithms and spectral leakage control.
- *Spectral Analysis for Physical Applications* — Percival & Walden. Focuses on periodograms, multitaper methods, and variance estimation.

## Applied References
- *NI LabVIEW Spectrum Analysis Toolkit Manual*. Demonstrates practical implementation of FFT-based measurement workflows.
- *Keysight Spectrum Analyzer Application Notes*. Real-world guidance on window selection, averaging, and noise-floor corrections.
