# C1-L3_Time-Frequency-Transforms — Class Index
**Definition:** Techniques that shift between time narratives and spectral fingerprints to reveal periodicity and transients.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Order (L4) — index
- O1-L4_Fourier-&-Spectrum-Views — steady-state decompositions that expose tone strength and phase.
- O2-L4_Wavelet-&-Time-Frequency-Tiles — multiscale tiles that chase bursts and chirps through time.
## Family (L5) — highlights
- O1 > F1-L5_Audio-&-Vibration-Spectra — FFT diagnostics for mixes, machines, and tonal signatures.
- O2 > F1-L5_Short-Time_Windowing_Patterns — plan spectrogram windows to frame transients cleanly.
- O2 > F2-L5_Wavelet_Bank_Playbooks — pick mother wavelets and scales that surface hidden events.
## Genus (L6) — toolkits in play
- Music-mix vs machine-diagnostic comparisons, anti-alias design guides, STFT tuning charts, multi-resolution planners, wavelet family pickers, and scalogram interpreters.
## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- Podcast EQ fixes, factory vibration audits, subway spectrogram reviews, power quality wavelet alarms, and seizure scalogram scans.
