# C2-L3_Digital-Sampling-&-Coding — Class Index
**Definition:** How continuous signals become bit streams, with sample timing, quantization, and codes that survive noisy links and tight storage.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Order (L4) — index
- O1-L4_Sampling-Theorem-&-Aliasing — keeping discrete-time captures faithful and spotting folds when limits are pushed.
- O2-L4_Coding-&-Compression_Frameworks — structuring bits for efficiency and resilience over storage and links.
## Family (L5) — cross-order highlights
- O1 > F1-L5_Sampling-Workflow_Planning — plan sample rates and front-ends before ever hitting record.
- O1 > F2-L5_Aliasing_Diagnostics-&-Fixes — catch and repair folded spectra after capture.
- O2 > F1-L5_Source_Coding_Playbooks — squeeze redundancy while keeping the story intelligible.
- O2 > F2-L5_Channel_Coding_Safeguards — add parity, redundancy, and modulation pairings to survive noise.
## Genus (L6) — toolkits to watch
- Anti-alias filters, sample-rate tradeoff charts, alias detection dashboards, and remediation playbooks.
- Lossless codec comparisons, lossy bitrate balancers, error-correcting code planners, and coded modulation integrators.
## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- Audio interface anti-alias tune-ups, surveillance frame-rate selections, satellite link LDPC rollouts, and streaming codec balancing acts.
