# O2 Coding & Compression Frameworks — Book Suggestions

These books highlight information theory, lossless and lossy coding, and error-control schemes for measurement data pipelines.

## Foundational Primers
- *Elements of Information Theory* — Cover & Thomas. Standard reference for entropy, mutual information, and capacity results.
- *Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms* — David MacKay. Blends coding theory with Bayesian inference and practical examples.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Rate-Distortion Theory* — Berger. Rigorous treatment of lossy compression limits and algorithms.
- *Error Control Coding* — Shu Lin & Daniel Costello. Comprehensive coverage of block, convolutional, and LDPC codes.

## Applied References
- *JPEG2000 Image Compression Fundamentals* — Taubman & Marcellin. Demonstrates wavelet-based compression and rate control.
- *NASA Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Standards*. Official specifications for telemetry compression and coding schemes.
