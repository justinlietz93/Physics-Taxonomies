# O2-L4_Coding-&-Compression_Frameworks — Order Index
**Definition:** Crafting bit-efficient, error-tolerant representations so sampled data travels and stores reliably.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- F1-L5_Source_Coding_Playbooks — squeeze redundancy in the data itself while preserving meaning.
- F2-L5_Channel_Coding_Safeguards — armor the bitstream against noise, fades, and dropouts.
## Genus (L6) — resilient building blocks
- Lossless codec comparisons, lossy bitrate balancing guides, error-correcting code planners, and modulation-coding co-design kits.
## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- Datacenter log compression rollouts, spacecraft telemetry packing plans, satellite link LDPC setups, and 5G baseband constellation audits.
