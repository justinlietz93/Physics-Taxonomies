# C2 Digital Sampling & Coding — Book Suggestions

Digital sampling captures analog signals, while coding compresses and protects data. These resources cover sampling theory, quantization, and source/channel coding.

## Sampling & Reconstruction
- *Discrete-Time Signal Processing* — Oppenheim & Schafer. Explores sampling, aliasing, and reconstruction filters.
- *Sampling Theory and Practice* — John R. Higgins. Rigorous treatment of Nyquist criteria and bandlimited interpolation.

## Quantization & Compression
- *Vector Quantization and Signal Compression* — Allen Gersho & Robert M. Gray. Provides quantization algorithms and rate–distortion theory.
- *Digital Signal Compression* — Richard G. Baraniuk. Surveys transform and subband coding techniques.

## Error Control Coding
- *Error Control Coding* — Shu Lin & Daniel J. Costello. Comprehensive text on block and convolutional codes.
- *Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms* — David J.C. MacKay. Links coding theory with probabilistic inference.
