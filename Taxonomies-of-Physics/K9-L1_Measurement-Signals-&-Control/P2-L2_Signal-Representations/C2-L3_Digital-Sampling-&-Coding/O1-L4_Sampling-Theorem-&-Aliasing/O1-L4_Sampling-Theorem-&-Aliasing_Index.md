# O1-L4_Sampling-Theorem-&-Aliasing — Order Index
**Definition:** Planning sample timing and anti-alias protection so discrete captures mirror the original waveform, and diagnosing folds when guardrails slip.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- F1-L5_Sampling-Workflow_Planning — shape sample rates, filters, and timing budgets before committing to hardware.
- F2-L5_Aliasing_Diagnostics-&-Fixes — hunt down folded content and apply corrective playbooks after capture.
## Genus (L6) — signal health gauges
- Anti-alias filter design kits, sample-rate tradeoff charts, alias detection dashboards, and remediation strategy binders.
## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- Audio interface front-end tune-ups, surveillance camera frame-rate plans, oscilloscope folded-tone debriefs, and drone propeller sensor reposition checklists.
