# F1-L5_Sampling-Workflow_Planning — Family Index
**Definition:** Front-end planning that balances anti-alias filters, sample clocks, and rate budgets before data collection begins.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Genus (L6) — index
- G1-L6_Anti-Alias_Filter-Designs — choose cutoffs and slopes that guard Nyquist boundaries without mangling passbands.
- G2-L6_Sample-Rate_Selection_Guides — weigh bandwidth, storage, and latency before locking the master clock.
## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- Audio interface front-end tune-ups, IMU datalogger anti-alias checklists, surveillance camera frame-rate selections, and power grid PMU scheduling briefs.
