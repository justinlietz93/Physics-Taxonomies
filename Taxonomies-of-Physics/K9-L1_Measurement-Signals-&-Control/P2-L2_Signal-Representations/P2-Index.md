# P2–L2 Signal Representations
**Definition:** Ways of viewing signals—time traces, spectra, code words—that highlight structure and make processing efficient.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- C1-L3_Time-Frequency-Transforms — toggling between temporal stories and spectral fingerprints.
- C2-L3_Digital-Sampling-&-Coding — representing signals with bits, symbols, and compression schemes.
