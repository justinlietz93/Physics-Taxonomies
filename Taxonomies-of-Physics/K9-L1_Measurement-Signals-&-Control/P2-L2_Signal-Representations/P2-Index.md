# P2–L2 Signal Representations
**Definition:** Ways of viewing signals—time traces, spectra, code words—that highlight structure and make processing efficient.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- C1-L3_Time-Frequency-Transforms — toggling between temporal stories and spectral fingerprints.
- C2-L3_Digital-Sampling-&-Coding — representing signals with bits, symbols, and compression schemes.
## Order (L4) — active trails
- C1: O1-L4_Fourier-&-Spectrum-Views, O2-L4_Wavelet-&-Time-Frequency-Tiles — spectrum and multiresolution storytelling.
- C2: O1-L4_Sampling-Theorem-&-Aliasing, O2-L4_Coding-&-Compression_Frameworks — discrete-time planning and robust bitstreams.
## Family (L5) — featured playbooks
- Anti-alias planning, alias remediation, sampling workflows, and FFT diagnostics anchor the C1 class.
- Wavelet windowing, wavelet bank selection, source coding, and channel coding kits power C2.
## Genus (L6) — go-to toolkits
- STFT tuning guides, sample-rate selectors, anti-alias filters, codec comparisons, error-correction planners, and scalogram interpreters.
## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- Audio interface anti-alias tune-ups, subway spectrogram audits, streaming codec balances, satellite LDPC setups, and seizure wavelet scans.
