# O2 Time-Domain Fluctuations — Book Suggestions

These texts emphasize stochastic time-domain analysis, noise statistics, and correlation tools for measurement signals.

## Foundational Primers
- *Stochastic Processes and Filtering Theory* — Andrew Jazwinski. Introduces autocorrelation, covariance, and time-domain statistics.
- *An Introduction to Stochastic Processes in Physics* — Don S. Lemons. Provides intuitive treatments of noise sources and Poisson statistics.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Allan Variance: Techniques and Applications* — G. Petit & Z. Jiang (eds.). Focus on oscillator time-domain stability analysis.
- *Statistical Signal Analysis of Time Series* — P. Stoica & R. Moses. Detailed coverage of covariance estimation and hypothesis testing.

## Applied References
- *NIST Handbook of Frequency Stability Analysis*. Practical computation of Allan deviation and related metrics.
- *Keysight Time-Domain Noise Application Note*. Demonstrates measurement setups for time-domain fluctuation analysis.
