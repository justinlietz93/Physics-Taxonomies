# C2 Stochastic Models & Simulation — Book Suggestions

Modeling noise processes and simulating stochastic systems support uncertainty analysis. These references cover stochastic calculus, random processes, and Monte Carlo simulation.

## Stochastic Process Theory
- *Stochastic Processes* — Sheldon Ross. Introduces Markov chains, Poisson processes, and renewal theory.
- *Stochastic Differential Equations* — Bernt Øksendal. Rigorous guide to SDEs and Ito calculus.

## Simulation Techniques
- *Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering* — Paul Glasserman. Presents variance reduction and stochastic simulation strategies applicable to measurement problems.
- *Stochastic Simulation* — Brian D. Ripley. Classic text on generating and simulating random processes.

## Practical Applications
- *Probabilistic Robotics* — Sebastian Thrun et al. Applies stochastic models to sensor fusion and control.
- *Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing* — Simo Särkkä. Covers Kalman, particle, and Gaussian-process filters for noisy systems.
