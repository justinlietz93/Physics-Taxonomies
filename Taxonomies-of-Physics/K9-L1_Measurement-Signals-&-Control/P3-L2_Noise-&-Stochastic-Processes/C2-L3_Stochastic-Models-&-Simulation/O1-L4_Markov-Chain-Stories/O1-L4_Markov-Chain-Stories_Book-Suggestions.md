- *Markov Chains* — J. R. Norris. Rigorous yet accessible treatment with proofs and practical examples.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — N. G. van Kampen. Explores master equations and detailed balance for physical systems.
- *Markov Chains and Mixing Times* — Levin, Peres & Wilmer. Focuses on convergence rates and coupling techniques.

## Applied References
