# C1 State Estimation Techniques — Book Suggestions

State estimation combines noisy measurements with models to infer hidden states. These references introduce Kalman filtering, Bayesian estimation, and nonlinear observers.

## Kalman Filtering
- *Kalman Filtering: Theory and Practice* — Mohinder S. Grewal & Angus P. Andrews. Practical guide to linear and extended filters.
- *Optimal Filtering* — Brian D.O. Anderson & John B. Moore. Rigorous derivation of Kalman and smoothing algorithms.

## Nonlinear & Bayesian Methods
- *Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing* — Simo Särkkä. Covers particle filters, unscented transforms, and smoothing.
- *Applied Optimal Estimation* — Arthur Gelb (ed.). Classic text on estimation theory and aerospace applications.

## Application Case Studies
- *Probabilistic Robotics* — Thrun, Burgard & Fox. Demonstrates localization and SLAM as estimation problems.
- *Estimation and Control of Large-Scale Networked Systems* — A. Bemporad et al. Addresses distributed estimation and sensor networks.
