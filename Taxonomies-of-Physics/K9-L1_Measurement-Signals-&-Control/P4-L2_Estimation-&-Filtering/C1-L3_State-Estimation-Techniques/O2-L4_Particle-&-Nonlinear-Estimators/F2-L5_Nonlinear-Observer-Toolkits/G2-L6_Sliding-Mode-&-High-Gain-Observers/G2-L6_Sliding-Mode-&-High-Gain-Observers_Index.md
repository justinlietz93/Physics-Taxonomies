# G2-L6_Sliding-Mode-&-High-Gain-Observers — Genus Index
**Definition:** Robust observer setups that use sharp gains or switching surfaces to overpower disturbances.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Electric_Motor_Torque-Observer_Setup — sliding-mode observer for motor torque under load swings.
- S2-L7_Bioprocess_Fermentation-State_Watch — high-gain observer keeping fermentation states stable.
