# O2 Frequency-Domain Filter Designs — Book Suggestions

These books emphasize frequency-domain synthesis, analog-to-digital transformations, and optimal approximation methods.

## Foundational Primers
- *Analog and Digital Filter Design* — Steve Winder. Covers bilinear transforms, prototype mapping, and specification translation.
- *Digital Filters* — R. W. Hamming. Classical reference on frequency-sampling techniques and Chebyshev approximations.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Linear Phase and Equiripple FIR Digital Filters* — Parks & McClellan. Deep dive into Remez exchange and minimax design.
- *Design of Analog Filters* — Rolf Schaumann & Mac Van Valkenburg. Provides analog prototypes and transformation strategies for digital implementation.

## Applied References
- *Keysight Filter Design Guide*. Practical workflows for meeting frequency-domain specs in instrumentation.
- *MATLAB Filter Design HDL Coder Documentation*. Shows frequency-domain optimization feeding hardware synthesis.
