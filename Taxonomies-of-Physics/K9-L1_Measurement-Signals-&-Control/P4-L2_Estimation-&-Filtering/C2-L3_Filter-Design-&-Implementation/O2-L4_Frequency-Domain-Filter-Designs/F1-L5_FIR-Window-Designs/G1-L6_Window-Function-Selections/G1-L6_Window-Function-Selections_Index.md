# G1-L6_Window-Function-Selections — Genus Index
**Definition:** Comparing window functions to balance transition width and sidelobe ripple in FIR filters.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Audio_Mixing_Notch-Filter_Build — selecting windows for stage monitor notch filters.
- S2-L7_Manufacturing_Vibration_Bandstop — shaping vibration filters for rotating machinery.
