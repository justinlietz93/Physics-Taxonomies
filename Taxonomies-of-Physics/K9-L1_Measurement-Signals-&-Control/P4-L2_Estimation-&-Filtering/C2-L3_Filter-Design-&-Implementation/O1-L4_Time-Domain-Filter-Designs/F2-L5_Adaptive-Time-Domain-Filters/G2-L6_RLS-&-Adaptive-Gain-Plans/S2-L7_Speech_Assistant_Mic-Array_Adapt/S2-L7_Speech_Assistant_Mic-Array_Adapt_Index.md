# S2-L7_Speech_Assistant_Mic-Array_Adapt — Species Index
**Definition:** Schedules adaptive gains so smart-speaker microphone arrays stay focused on a moving talker.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Voice UX teams rotate beam patterns while adjusting adaptive gains to follow a user pacing the room.
- They describe fallback schedules that freeze adaptation when music playback could confuse the estimator.
