# C2 Filter Design & Implementation — Book Suggestions

Filters shape signal spectra to enhance desired content or reject noise. These references cover analog and digital filter synthesis, implementation, and real-time deployment.

## Analog & Digital Design
- *Digital Signal Processing: Principles, Algorithms, and Applications* — Proakis & Manolakis. Comprehensive DSP text covering IIR and FIR filter design.
- *Analog Filter Design* — M.E. Van Valkenburg. Classic guide to continuous-time filters and realizations.

## Implementation Techniques
- *Understanding Digital Signal Processing* — Richard Lyons. Practical insights into filter structures and fixed-point effects.
- *Embedded Signal Processing with the Micro Signal Architecture* — Woon-Seng Gan & Sen M. Kuo. Focuses on real-time DSP implementation.

## Advanced Topics
- *Multirate Signal Processing* — Ronald E. Crochiere & Lawrence R. Rabiner. Discusses decimation, interpolation, and polyphase filters.
- *Design of IIR Digital Filters Using MATLAB* — Andreas Antoniou. Provides software-based design workflows.
