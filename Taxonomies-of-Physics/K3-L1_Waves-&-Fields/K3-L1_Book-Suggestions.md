# K3 Waves & Fields — Book Suggestions

These references give a panoramic view of vibrations, interference, and field theory so that later phyla can specialize in acoustics, electromagnetism, or nonlinear waves without losing the shared language.

## Foundational Overviews
- *Waves in Physics* — Peter S. Bernard & Jeffrey M. Shragge. Covers wave equations, dispersion, and boundary interactions with cross-domain examples.
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Classic MIT text linking mechanical, acoustic, and electromagnetic wave behavior with clear experiments and problems.

## Field-Theoretic Perspectives
- *Introduction to Electrodynamics* — David J. Griffiths. While centered on EM, its field viewpoint, boundary methods, and radiation tools generalize across wave phenomena.
- *Classical Field Theory* — Davison Soper. Presents the Lagrangian language for fields and waves, aligning with the symmetry and conservation lenses.

## Applied & Computational Guides
- *Computational Wave Dynamics* — Yiannis A. Dimakopoulos. Demonstrates numerical methods for propagation, dispersion, and scattering relevant to multiple phyla.
- *The Physics of Vibrations and Waves* — H. John Pain. Provides problem-rich coverage from strings to cavities, reinforcing resonance and interference themes.
