# C2 Coherence, Sources & Detection — Book Suggestions

Interference visibility hinges on coherence prepared at the source and preserved by detectors. These references trace coherence from statistical definitions to lab instrumentation.

## Theoretical Foundations
- *Statistical Optics* — Joseph W. Goodman. Introduces coherence functions, mutual intensity, and detection statistics for partially coherent light.
- *Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics* — Leonard Mandel & Emil Wolf. Provides a comprehensive treatment of coherence theory spanning classical and quantum limits.

## Source Engineering
- *Laser Fundamentals* — William T. Silfvast. Explains how laser cavities, gain media, and linewidth control create highly coherent beams.
- *Synchrotron Radiation and Free-Electron Lasers* — Kwang-Je Kim, Zhirong Huang & Ryan Lindberg. Describes accelerator-based sources and their temporal and spatial coherence properties.

## Detection & Measurement
- *Optical Coherence Tomography* — Wolfgang Drexler & James G. Fujimoto. Demonstrates coherence gating in biomedical imaging and the instrumentation that supports it.
- *Single-Photon Detection and Measurement* — Manuel Fernandez-Alonso & David L. Andrews (eds.). Surveys detectors capable of resolving coherence at the photon-counting level.
