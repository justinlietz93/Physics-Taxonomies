# O1 Source Preparation-and Stabilization — Book Suggestions

Reliable interference and diffraction experiments demand phase-stable sources. These books describe how lasers, microwave oscillators, and acoustic emitters are conditioned for coherence.

## Coherent Light Sources
- *Laser Electronics* — Joseph T. Verdeyen. Explains gain media, cavity design, and stabilization techniques that set laser linewidths and coherence times.
- *Laser Resonators and Beam Control* — Alexis V. Kudryashov & Alan H. Paxton. Focuses on mode control, alignment, and thermal management to keep optical sources phase stable.

## Microwave and RF Oscillators
- *Microwave Engineering* — David M. Pozar. Covers frequency synthesizers, phase-locked loops, and oscillator noise budgeting for coherent RF sources.
- *Phase-Locked Loops: Design, Simulation, and Applications* — Roland E. Best. Provides detailed PLL design methods to lock oscillator phase and frequency for multi-source experiments.

## Characterization and Metrology
- *Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics* — Leonard Mandel & Emil Wolf. Offers measurement strategies for coherence length, visibility, and statistical stability of sources.
- *Frequency Measurement and Control* — Andre N. Luiten. Describes reference cavities, atomic standards, and feedback electronics used to stabilize frequency-agile sources across the spectrum.
