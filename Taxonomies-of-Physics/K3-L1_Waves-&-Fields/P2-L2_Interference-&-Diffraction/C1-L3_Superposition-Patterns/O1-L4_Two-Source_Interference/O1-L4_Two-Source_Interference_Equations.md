# O1 Two-Source Interference â€” Core Equations

Interference fringes stem from phase differences between coherent sources. These equations set the conditions for bright and dark regions.

## Path Difference and Phase
**Geometric path difference:**

$$\Delta L = d \sin \theta$$

- Separation \(d\) between sources and observation angle \(\theta\) determine how much further one wave travels than the other.

**Phase difference:**

$$\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta L + \Delta \phi_{0}$$

- Path difference and any initial phase offset \(\Delta \phi_{0}\) sum to give the total phase mismatch at the detector.

## Bright and Dark Conditions
**Constructive interference:**

$$\Delta L = m \lambda \quad (m = 0, \pm1, \pm2, \ldots)$$

- Integer multiples of the wavelength align crests with crests, producing intensity maxima.

**Destructive interference:**

$$\Delta L = \left(m + \tfrac{1}{2}\right) \lambda$$

- Half-wavelength offsets cancel the waves, producing minima when the source amplitudes are equal.

## Intensity Patterns
**Two-source intensity profile:**

$$I(\theta) = I_{1} + I_{2} + 2 \sqrt{I_{1} I_{2}} \, V \, \cos \Delta \phi$$

- Individual intensities \(I_{1}, I_{2}\) and fringe visibility \(V\) set the modulation depth. Perfect coherence gives \(V = 1\).

**Fringe spacing on a screen:**

$$\Delta y = \frac{\lambda L}{d}$$

- For far-field screens at distance \(L\), adjacent bright fringes are separated by \(\Delta y\), letting measurements recover wavelength or source spacing.
