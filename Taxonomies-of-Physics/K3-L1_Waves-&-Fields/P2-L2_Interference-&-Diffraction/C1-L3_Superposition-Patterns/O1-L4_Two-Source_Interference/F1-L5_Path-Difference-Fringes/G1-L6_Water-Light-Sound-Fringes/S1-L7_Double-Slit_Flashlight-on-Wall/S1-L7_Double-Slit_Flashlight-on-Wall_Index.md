# S1-L7_Double-Slit_Flashlight-on-Wall — Species Index
**Definition:** A flashlight shining through two narrow slits casts bright and dim stripes that reveal simple interference.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Light from each slit travels slightly different distances to each point on the wall, causing peaks or cancellations.
- The spacing between stripes changes if you move the slits, shift the screen, or swap the light color.
