# O1 Two-Source Interference — Book Suggestions

These books emphasize phase control and path differences so learners can predict and measure the bright–dark fringe structure of two-source setups.

## Conceptual Foundations
- *The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III* — Richard P. Feynman, Robert B. Leighton & Matthew Sands. Provides narrative explanations and thought experiments for double-slit and two-antenna interference.
- *Optics* — Eugene Hecht. Derives interference conditions for coherent light sources, covering both amplitude and intensity calculations.

## Laboratory and Engineering Guides
- *Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics* — Leonard Mandel & Emil Wolf. Supplies coherence length, visibility, and statistical tools for real-world interferometry.
- *Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design* — Constantine A. Balanis. Connects phase-controlled antenna elements to far-field interference patterns and beam steering.

## Measurement Playbooks
- *Introduction to Modern Optics* — Grant R. Fowles. Offers practical two-beam interference experiments, fringe-counting methods, and visibility calibration.
- *Microwave Engineering* — David M. Pozar. Details network analyzer setups and phasing circuits that tune interference between microwave sources.
