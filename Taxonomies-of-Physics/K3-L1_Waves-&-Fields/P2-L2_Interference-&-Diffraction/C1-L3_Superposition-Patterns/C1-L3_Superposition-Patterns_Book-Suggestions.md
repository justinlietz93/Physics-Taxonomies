# C1 Superposition Patterns — Book Suggestions

Interference diagrams translate overlapping waves into bright and dark structure. These resources explain how phase, coherence, and geometry weave recognizable patterns.

## Foundational Texts
- *Optics* — Eugene Hecht. Covers double-slit interference, fringe spacing, and coherence length with clear derivations and illustrations.
- *The Physics of Vibrations and Waves* — H. John Pain. Builds superposition principles across mechanical and electromagnetic examples, keeping the emphasis on visualization.

## Analytical Approaches
- *Introduction to Fourier Optics* — Joseph W. Goodman. Develops the Fourier-transform perspective that turns apertures into predictable interference maps.
- *Principles of Optics* — Born & Wolf. Provides the rigorous vector treatment for complex interference and polarization states.

## Experimental Playbooks
- *Optical Shop Testing* — Daniel Malacara. Demonstrates interferometric setups that convert theory into measurable fringe patterns.
- *Holographic Imaging* — Stephen A. Benton & V. Michael Bove Jr. Explores interference-based recording methods that rely on precise control of coherence and phase.
