# C1 Superposition Patterns â€” Core Equations

Superposition patterns arise from adding oscillations with controlled phase relations. These expressions forecast fringe spacing, brightness, and node placement in canonical setups.

## Linear Superposition
**Summed displacement for two waves:**

$$u(x,t) = u_{1}(x,t) + u_{2}(x,t)$$

- The displacement or field at any point is the algebraic sum of individual contributions, allowing interference to emerge from constructive and destructive combinations.

**Complex phasor addition:**

$$E = E_{1} e^{i\phi_{1}} + E_{2} e^{i\phi_{2}}$$

- Using phasors keeps amplitude and phase bookkeeping tidy, enabling vector addition in the complex plane for multiple beams.

## Two-Beam Interference Intensity
**Intensity with phase difference:**

$$I = I_{1} + I_{2} + 2 \sqrt{I_{1} I_{2}} \cos \Delta \phi$$

- Shows how brightness oscillates with phase difference $\Delta \phi$, capturing full-contrast fringes when equal intensities overlap coherently.

**Path difference to phase shift:**

$$\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \Delta L$$

- Converts geometric path length difference $\Delta L$ into phase, making fringe spacing predictions a matter of geometry.

## Double-Slit Fringe Geometry
**Fringe spacing on a screen:**

$$\Delta y = \frac{\lambda L}{d}$$

- Predicts separation between bright fringes for slit separation $d$, wavelength $\lambda$, and screen distance $L$ under the small-angle approximation.

**m-th bright fringe position:**

$$y_{m} = m \frac{\lambda L}{d}$$

- Labels the location of each constructive interference stripe with integer order $m$, matching observations from tabletop experiments.
