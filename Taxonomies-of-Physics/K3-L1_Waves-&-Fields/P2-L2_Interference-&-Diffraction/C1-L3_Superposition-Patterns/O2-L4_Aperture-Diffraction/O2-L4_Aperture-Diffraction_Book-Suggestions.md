# O2 Aperture-Diffraction — Book Suggestions

These sources dive into how finite apertures sculpt wavefronts, from textbook Fraunhofer patterns to engineered diffractive optics.

## Foundational Treatments
- *Introduction to Fourier Optics* — Joseph W. Goodman. Establishes the Fourier-transform approach to aperture diffraction, covering Fresnel and Fraunhofer limits with worked examples.
- *Optics* — Eugene Hecht. Provides accessible derivations of single-slit, double-slit, and circular-aperture intensity formulas.

## Advanced and Computational Views
- *Principles of Optics* — Max Born & Emil Wolf. Offers rigorous vector diffraction theory, polarization effects, and near-field corrections.
- *Diffractive Optics: Design, Fabrication, and Test* — Donald C. O'Shea et al. Links diffraction integrals with practical computation of holograms and beam shapers.

## Experimental Playbooks
- *Practical Optical System Layout: And Use of Stock Lenses* — Warren J. Smith. Shows how to size apertures, stops, and screens to control diffraction artifacts in real instruments.
- *Field Guide to Diffractive Optics* — Joseph A. Davis. Supplies quick-reference formulas, design charts, and laboratory tips for measuring diffraction efficiency and spot sizes.
