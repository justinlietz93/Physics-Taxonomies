# O1 Soliton Formation — Book Suggestions

These books explain how nonlinearity balances dispersion to create self-sustaining wave packets in fluids, optics, and plasmas.

## Foundational Texts
- *Solitons: An Introduction* — P. G. Drazin & R. S. Johnson. Builds the mathematical framework for KdV, NLS, and sine-Gordon solitons.
- *Nonlinear Waves, Solitons and Chaos* — Eryk Infeld & George Rowlands. Provides physical insight and worked examples across fluids, plasmas, and optical media.

## Optical and Fiber Solitons
- *Nonlinear Fiber Optics* — Govind P. Agrawal. Covers bright, dark, and higher-order solitons with laboratory design guidelines.
- *Optical Solitons: From Fibers to Photonic Crystals* — Yuri S. Kivshar & Govind P. Agrawal. Extends soliton concepts to discrete and photonic-lattice systems.

## Fluid and Plasma Contexts
- *Introduction to Nonlinear Waves* — Anatoli P. Kurkin & Vera I. Kurbatskaya. Discusses shallow-water and internal-wave solitons with observational case studies.
- *Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion* — Francis F. Chen. Describes ion-acoustic and magnetosonic solitons in plasma environments.
