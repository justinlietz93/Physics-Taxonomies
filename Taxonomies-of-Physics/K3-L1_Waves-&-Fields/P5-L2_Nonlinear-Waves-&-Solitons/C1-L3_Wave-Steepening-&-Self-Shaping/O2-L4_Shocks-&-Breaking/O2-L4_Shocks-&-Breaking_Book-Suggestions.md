# O2 Shocks & Breaking — Book Suggestions

These texts explore how nonlinear steepening leads to shock formation and wave breaking in fluids, plasmas, and traffic-like systems.

## Foundations of Shock Dynamics
- *Nonlinear Waves* — A. Jeffrey & T. Kawahara. Covers Burgers, KdV, and shallow-water equations with emphasis on shock development and dissipation.
- *Partial Differential Equations of Applied Mathematics* — Erich Zauderer. Provides method-of-characteristics treatments for first-order hyperbolic PDEs that form discontinuities.

## Fluid and Atmospheric Breaking
- *Breaking and Nonlinear Waves in Shallow Water* — Andrei K. Kostianoy & Mark A. Lavrentiev. Focuses on hydraulic jumps, bores, and coastal wave breaking.
- *Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics* — Geoffrey K. Vallis. Discusses shock-like fronts and wave breaking in geophysical flows.

## Plasma and Traffic Analogues
- *Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion* — Francis F. Chen. Examines collisionless shocks and steepening in magnetized plasmas.
- *Traffic Flow Dynamics* — Martin Treiber & Arne Kesting. Presents kinematic-wave shock models as analogues for nonlinear wave breaking in transport systems.
