# C1 Wave Steepening & Self-Shaping — Book Suggestions

Nonlinear media can sharpen wavefronts or carve pulses into new shapes. These books trace how amplitude-dependent speeds lead to shocks, solitons, and self-steepening behaviors.

## Introductory Perspectives
- *Nonlinear Waves in Fluids* — A.D.D. Craik. Builds intuition for steepening, breaking, and bore formation in shallow-water and acoustic systems.
- *Nonlinear Acoustics* — Mark F. Hamilton & David T. Blackstock. Connects amplitude-dependent sound speed to waveform distortion and shock formation.

## Mathematical Frameworks
- *Nonlinear Waves* — A.C. Newell. Presents multiple-scale methods and perturbation theory for tracking evolving wave shapes.
- *Partial Differential Equations of Applied Mathematics* — Erich Zauderer. Offers characteristic and shock-capturing techniques applicable to steepening problems.

## Applications & Case Studies
- *Ultrashort Laser Pulse Phenomena* — Jean-Claude Diels & Wolfgang Rudolph. Details self-phase modulation and optical self-steepening in fibers and gases.
- *Traffic Flow Dynamics* — Martin Treiber & Arne Kesting. Demonstrates how nonlinear wave steepening concepts translate to congestion shockwaves.
