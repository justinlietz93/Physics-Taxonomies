# O1 Soliton Creation and Guiding — Book Suggestions

These references focus on launching solitons and steering them through engineered media with controlled dispersion and nonlinearity.

## Launch and Initialization
- *Nonlinear Fiber Optics* — Govind P. Agrawal. Provides launch conditions, phase matching, and pump configurations for fiber solitons.
- *Optical Solitons: From Fibers to Photonic Crystals* — Yuri S. Kivshar & Govind P. Agrawal. Discusses input shaping, lattice loading, and discrete soliton excitation.

## Waveguide and Lattice Control
- *Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light* — John D. Joannopoulos et al. Explains dispersion engineering and defect states for guiding solitons.
- *Nonlinear Photonic Crystals* — Richart E. Slusher & Benjamin J. Eggleton (eds.). Presents experimental methods for routing solitons in periodic structures.

## Diagnostics and Stabilization
- *Femtosecond Optical Frequency Comb Technology* — Jun Ye & Steven T. Cundiff (eds.). Describes spectral diagnostics and stabilization needed to maintain guided solitons.
- *Optical Waveguide Theory* — Allan W. Snyder & John D. Love. Provides coupled-mode and variational tools for predicting soliton trajectories in multi-mode structures.
