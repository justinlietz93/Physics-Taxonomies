# C2 Energy Focusing & Soliton Control — Book Suggestions

Solitons balance dispersion and nonlinearity to preserve energy localization. These resources explain how to generate, steer, and stabilize solitary waves in diverse platforms.

## Core Soliton Theory
- *Solitons: An Introduction* — P.G. Drazin & R.S. Johnson. Covers inverse scattering, integrable models, and the canonical KdV and nonlinear Schrödinger solitons.
- *The Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation* — Catherine Sulem & Pierre-Louis Sulem. Provides rigorous and applied treatments of soliton solutions and their stability.

## Control Techniques
- *Optical Solitons: From Fibers to Photonic Crystals* — Yuri S. Kivshar & Govind P. Agrawal. Describes dispersion management, amplification, and perturbation methods to shepherd optical solitons.
- *Bose–Einstein Condensation in Dilute Gases* — C.J. Pethick & H. Smith. Explores matter-wave solitons and techniques for tuning interactions via Feshbach resonances.

## Experimental Case Studies
- *Hydrodynamic Solitons and Their Interactions* — Nail Akhmediev & Adrian Ankiewicz (eds.). Collects laboratory realizations ranging from water channels to plasma solitons.
- *Nonlinear Optics* — Robert W. Boyd. Provides practical insights on optical parametric processes and stability criteria relevant to soliton experiments.
