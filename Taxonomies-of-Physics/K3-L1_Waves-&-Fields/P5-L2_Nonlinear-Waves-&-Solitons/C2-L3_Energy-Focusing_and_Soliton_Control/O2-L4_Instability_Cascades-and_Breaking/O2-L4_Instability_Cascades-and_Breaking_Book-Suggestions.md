# O2 Instability Cascades and Breaking — Book Suggestions

These titles examine how solitons destabilize, cascade into turbulence, or break through modulational and transverse instabilities.

## Modulational Instability
- *Nonlinear Fiber Optics* — Govind P. Agrawal. Details modulation instability gain spectra and how they seed rogue waves and soliton fission.
- *The Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation: Self-Focusing and Wave Collapse* — Catherine Sulem & Pierre-Louis Sulem. Provides rigorous analysis of instability, collapse, and blowup scenarios.

## Higher-Dimensional Effects
- *Optical Solitons in Fibers* — Akira Hasegawa & Yasutake Kodama. Discusses soliton interactions, fission, and dispersive wave shedding in perturbed systems.
- *Hydrodynamic Instabilities* — François Charru. Covers Kelvin–Helmholtz, Rayleigh–Taylor, and parametric instabilities that can disrupt solitary waves in fluids.

## Numerical and Experimental Perspectives
- *Nonlinear Waves and Solitons on Contours and Closed Surfaces* — Andrei Ludu. Explores stability on complex geometries and the onset of wave breaking.
- *Rogue and Shock Waves in Nonlinear Dispersive Media* — Miguel Onorato, Stefano Residori & Fabio Baronio (eds.). Presents laboratory observations and simulations of instability cascades.
