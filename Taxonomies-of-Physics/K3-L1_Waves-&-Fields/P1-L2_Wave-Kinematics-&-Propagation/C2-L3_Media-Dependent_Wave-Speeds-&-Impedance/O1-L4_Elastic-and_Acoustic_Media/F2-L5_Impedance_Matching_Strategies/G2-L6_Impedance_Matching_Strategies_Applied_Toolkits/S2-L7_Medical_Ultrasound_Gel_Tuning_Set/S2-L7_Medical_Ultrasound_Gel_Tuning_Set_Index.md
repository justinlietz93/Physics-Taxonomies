# S2-L7_Medical_Ultrasound_Gel_Tuning_Set — Species Index
**Definition:** Clinic kit for swapping ultrasound gels to match patient tissue and boost image brightness.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes

- Sonographers keep warm, hypoallergenic, and high-viscosity gels ready, swapping while watching screen brightness in real time.
- Matching gel impedance to skin cuts reflection so more energy dives into tissue, clearing up vessels or tendons without boosting power.
