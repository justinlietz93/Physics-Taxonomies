# O1-L4_Elastic-and_Acoustic_Media — Order Index
**Definition:** How stiffness and density tune acoustic wave travel.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Bulk-and_Shear_Wave_Speeds** — compressional versus transverse modes in matter.
- **F2-L5_Impedance_Matching_Strategies** — transition layers and couplers that reduce reflections.
