# O1 Elastic-and Acoustic Media — Book Suggestions

These texts tie sound and elastic-wave speeds to stress–strain laws, enabling practical estimates in solids, fluids, and layered materials.

## Fundamentals of Sound Propagation
- *Fundamentals of Acoustics* — Lawrence E. Kinsler et al. Covers longitudinal and shear speeds through bulk modulus, shear modulus, and density relations for common materials.
- *The Physics of Sound* — Richard E. Berg & David G. Stork. Builds intuition for how compressibility and geometry shape acoustic impedance and transmission.

## Elastic Wave Theory
- *Theory of Elasticity* — Landau & Lifshitz. Provides derivations for P- and S-wave speeds, anisotropy, and stress tensor formulations used in solids and seismology.
- *Seismic Wave Propagation and Scattering* — Akira Takenaka & Tokihiko Shibutani. Bridges elastic constants with field measurements in layered earth models.

## Measurement and Applications
- *Ultrasonic Waves in Solid Media* — Joseph L. Rose. Details transducer techniques, dispersion corrections, and inverse methods for inferring elastic properties.
- *Acoustics: An Introduction to Its Physical Principles and Applications* — Allan D. Pierce. Supplies design examples for ducts, rooms, and underwater channels where impedance matching matters.
