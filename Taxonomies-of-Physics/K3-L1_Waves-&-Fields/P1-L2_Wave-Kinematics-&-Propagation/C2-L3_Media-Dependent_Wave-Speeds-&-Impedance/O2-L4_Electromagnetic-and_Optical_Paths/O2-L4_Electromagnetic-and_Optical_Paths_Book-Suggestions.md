# O2 Electromagnetic-and Optical Paths — Book Suggestions

These references show how dielectric, magnetic, and waveguide structures shape electromagnetic phase and group velocities along engineered paths.

## Foundational Electromagnetic Propagation
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John David Jackson. Derives wave propagation in dielectrics and conductors, including dispersion and attenuation constants.
- *Optics* — Eugene Hecht. Connects refractive index, Snell’s law, and wavefront construction to speed changes across layered optical systems.

## Guided-Wave Media
- *Foundations for Microwave Engineering* — Robert E. Collin. Explains modal dispersion, cutoff frequencies, and phase velocity behavior in rectangular, circular, and planar guides.
- *Fiber-Optic Communication Systems* — Govind P. Agrawal. Details chromatic dispersion, polarization mode dispersion, and how refractive-index profiles tailor pulse transport in fibers.

## Measurement and Design Handbooks
- *Principles of Optics* — Max Born & Emil Wolf. Provides rigorous treatments of refractive-index tensors, anisotropy, and group velocity in optical crystals.
- *Microwave Engineering* — David M. Pozar. Offers design formulas and charts for extracting effective permittivity and propagation constants in transmission lines and waveguides.
