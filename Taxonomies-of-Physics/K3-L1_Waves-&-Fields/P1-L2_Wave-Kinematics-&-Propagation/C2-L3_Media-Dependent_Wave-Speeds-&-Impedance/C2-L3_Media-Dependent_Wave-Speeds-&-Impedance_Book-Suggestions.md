# C2 Media-Dependent Wave Speeds & Impedance — Book Suggestions

Different materials reshape how waves accelerate, reflect, and transmit. These sources emphasize the impedance viewpoint that translates material properties into propagation rules.

## Core References
- *Waves and Fields in Inhomogeneous Media* — Weng Cho Chew. Explains how permittivity, permeability, and density profiles alter phase velocity and impedance.
- *Introduction to Wave Phenomena* — Akira Hirose & Karl Lonngren. Connects physical parameters with the general wave equation across acoustics, electromagnetics, and elastic media.

## Engineering Handbooks
- *Fundamentals of Acoustics* — Kinsler, Frey, Coppens & Sanders. Provides impedance charts and transmission models for layered sound media.
- *Microwave Engineering* — David M. Pozar. Details impedance matching, transmission lines, and material loading for guided electromagnetic waves.

## Applied Case Studies
- *Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light* — Joannopoulos, Johnson, Winn & Meade. Demonstrates how periodic dielectric structures engineer velocity and impedance.
- *Seismic Wave Propagation in Stratified Media* — Brian Kennett. Shows how earth layering modulates apparent speeds and reflections for geophysical surveys.
