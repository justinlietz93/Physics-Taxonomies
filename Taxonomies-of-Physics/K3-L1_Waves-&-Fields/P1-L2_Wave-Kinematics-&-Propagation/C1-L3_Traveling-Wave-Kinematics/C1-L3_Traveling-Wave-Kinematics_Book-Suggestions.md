# C1 Traveling Wave Kinematics — Book Suggestions

Traveling waves package energy and information into repeating packets that march through space. These class-level picks highlight how velocity, phase, and direction emerge from simple wave models.

## Conceptual Foundations
- *The Physics of Waves* — Howard Georgi. A concise derivation of one-dimensional wave kinematics that keeps sight of physical meaning and boundary intuitions.
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A.P. French. Builds phase, wavelength, and velocity relations through experiments and thought examples suited to introductory engineering courses.

## Mathematical Toolkits
- *Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences* — Mary L. Boas. Supplies the differential equation and complex exponential machinery that underpins traveling wave solutions.
- *Fourier Analysis and Its Applications* — Gerald B. Folland. Develops the frequency-domain picture needed to relate spatial and temporal wave numbers.

## Applied Case Studies
- *Waves in Plasmas* — Thomas H. Stix. Shows how simple kinematics extends to magnetized media where phase and group velocities decouple.
- *Introduction to Seismology* — Peter Shearer. Connects wavefront tracking and ray kinematics to real-world earth imaging problems.
