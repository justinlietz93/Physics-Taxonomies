# O2 Pulse-vs-Continuous Propagation — Book Suggestions

These resources contrast single-shot pulses with steady-state wave trains, showing how bandwidth, dispersion, and modulation reshape energy flow.

## Pulse Fundamentals
- *Ultrashort Laser Pulse Phenomena* — Jean-Claude Diels & Wolfgang Rudolph. Explains how femtosecond optical pulses stretch, chirp, and compress while traveling through real media.
- *Introduction to Optical Electronics* — Amnon Yariv. Lays out the Fourier language connecting temporal envelopes to carrier waves and spectral width.

## Continuous-Wave Perspectives
- *Engineering Vibration* — Daniel J. Inman. Uses harmonic steady-state solutions to demonstrate how continuous driving picks out resonance and filtering behaviors.
- *Classical Electromagnetic Radiation* — Mark A. Heald & Jerry B. Marion. Develops sinusoidal solutions and phasor techniques for radio-frequency propagation and antenna feeds.

## Bridging Tools and Measurements
- *Fourier Analysis and Its Applications* — Gerald B. Folland. Provides the transform machinery that links pulses to continuous spectra and clarifies bandwidth–duration tradeoffs.
- *Signals and Linear Systems Analysis* — Gordon E. Carlson. Offers laboratory-oriented methods for measuring impulse responses, step responses, and steady-state sinusoidal behavior in the same framework.
