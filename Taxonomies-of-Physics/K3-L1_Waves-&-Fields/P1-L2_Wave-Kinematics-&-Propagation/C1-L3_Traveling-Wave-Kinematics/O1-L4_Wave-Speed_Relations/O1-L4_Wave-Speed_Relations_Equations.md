# O1 Wave-Speed Relations — Core Equations

These relations connect measurable wave attributes—frequency, wavelength, and medium properties—to the propagation speed for traveling disturbances.

## Kinematic Identities
**Frequency–wavelength link:**

$$v = \lambda f$$

- A wave traveling with period \(T = 1/f\) advances one wavelength \(\lambda\) per cycle, so their product sets the uniform speed.

**Angular form for sinusoidal carriers:**

$$v = \frac{\omega}{k}$$

- Angular frequency \(\omega\) and wavenumber \(k = 2\pi/\lambda\) provide the same ratio using radians instead of cycles.

## Medium-Dependent Speeds
**Tensioned string or rope:**

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$

- Tension \(T\) (newtons) and linear density \(\mu\) (kilograms per meter) control transverse wave speed in slender elastic media.

**Electromagnetic waves in matter:**

$$v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon\mu}} = \frac{c}{n}$$

- Material permittivity \(\varepsilon = \varepsilon_{r}\varepsilon_{0}\) and permeability \(\mu = \mu_{r}\mu_{0}\) reduce the vacuum speed \(c\) according to the refractive index \(n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_{r}\mu_{r}}\).

## Diagnostic Conversions
**Group delay from phase speed:**

$$v_{p} = \frac{\omega}{k}, \qquad \tau_{\mathrm{group}} = \frac{L}{v_{g}}$$

- Phase speed \(v_{p}\) guides single-frequency fronts, while measurements often track group delay \(\tau_{\mathrm{group}}\) over path length \(L\) to recover the pulse velocity \(v_{g}\).

**Speed from time-of-flight measurements:**

$$v = \frac{L}{\Delta t}$$

- For laboratory timing, distance \(L\) between probes divided by arrival time \(\Delta t\) directly yields the propagation speed, grounding abstract formulas in experiment.
