# O1 Wave-Speed Relations — Book Suggestions

Wave speed connects frequency, wavelength, and medium response, so this reading list focuses on extracting and applying \(v = \lambda f\) style links across mechanical and electromagnetic settings.

## Core Wave Kinematics
- *Vibrations and Waves* — A. P. French. Walks through string, air column, and EM examples that build the algebraic relations between wavelength, period, and speed from first principles.
- *The Physics of Vibrations and Waves* — H. J. Pain. Provides a systematic derivation of wave equations and their characteristic speeds across tensioned media and dielectric guides.

## Medium Properties and Data
- *Fundamentals of Acoustics* — Lawrence E. Kinsler et al. Supplies elastic moduli, density tables, and derivations so acoustic wave speeds can be tied to measurable bulk properties.
- *Optics* — Eugene Hecht. Details how permittivity, permeability, and refractive index set electromagnetic phase velocities in transparent materials.

## Modeling and Measurement Guides
- *Introduction to Wave Phenomena* — Akira Hirose & Karl E. Lonngren. Couples laboratory techniques with modeling recipes for extracting speed from transient and steady-state wave experiments.
- *Signals and Systems* — Alan V. Oppenheim & Alan S. Willsky. Uses dispersion diagrams and Fourier viewpoints to connect pulse measurements with the underlying speed relations in different bands.
