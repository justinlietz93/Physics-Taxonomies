# O1 Dipole-vs Beam Radiation — Book Suggestions

These references compare elementary dipole radiation with engineered beam patterns, providing the foundations for antenna and optical beam design.

## Dipole Fundamentals
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John David Jackson. Derives dipole radiation fields, angular patterns, and power scaling from first principles.
- *Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design* — Constantine A. Balanis. Covers short-dipole approximations, polarization, and radiation resistance.

## Beam-Forming and Apertures
- *Antenna Arrays* — Randy L. Haupt. Focuses on phased-array synthesis, beam steering, and sidelobe control.
- *Lasers* — Anthony E. Siegman. Discusses Gaussian beam propagation, beam quality metrics, and optical resonator shaping.

## Measurement and Applications
- *Microwave Antenna Measurements* — Peter S. Kildal. Provides near- and far-field measurement setups for characterizing dipole and directive beams.
- *Laser Beam Propagation: Generation and Propagation of Customized Light* — Andrew Forbes et al. Explores spatial light modulators and beam-shaping optics to tailor radiation patterns.
