# O2 Scattering Geometries — Book Suggestions

These resources examine how object shape and orientation redistribute incident waves into scattered fields across acoustic, electromagnetic, and optical regimes.

## Core Scattering Theory
- *Scattering Theory of Waves and Particles* — Roger G. Newton. Provides mathematical foundations for scattering amplitudes and cross sections.
- *Acoustical Scattering* — Murray S. Karp. Focuses on acoustic and elastic scattering from canonical shapes with analytic solutions.

## Electromagnetic Examples
- *Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics* — Constantine A. Balanis. Covers Mie scattering, perfectly conducting objects, and numerical methods for arbitrary geometries.
- *Light Scattering by Small Particles* — H. C. van de Hulst. Discusses size parameter regimes, polarization effects, and practical measurement techniques.

## Numerical and Applied Tools
- *Computational Electrodynamics* — Allen Taflove & Susan C. Hagness. Introduces FDTD and related numerical methods for complex scatterers.
- *Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering Analysis Using Discrete Sources* — Jian-Ming Jin. Demonstrates boundary integral and discrete-source techniques for irregular geometries.
