# C1 Source Patterns & Emission — Book Suggestions

Radiated fields depend on how sources accelerate charge or mass. These references translate current distributions into far-field patterns and power estimates.

## Core Electromagnetic Texts
- *Classical Electromagnetic Radiation* — Mark A. Heald & Jerry B. Marion. Covers retarded potentials, dipole radiation, and multipole expansions with clear derivations.
- *Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design* — Constantine A. Balanis. Provides canonical radiation patterns, directivity formulas, and design examples.

## Acoustic & Elastic Sources
- *Fundamentals of Acoustics* — Kinsler, Frey, Coppens & Sanders. Addresses monopole, dipole, and quadrupole sound sources and their radiation efficiencies.
- *Elastic Wave Radiation from Sources in Solids* — R. Burridge & L. Knopoff. Explains seismic source representations and far-field pattern construction.

## Numerical & Measurement Guides
- *Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method* — Allen Taflove & Susan C. Hagness. Demonstrates numerical extraction of radiation patterns from simulated sources.
- *Antenna Measurements* — Lars Josefsson & Patrik Persson. Details anechoic chamber setups and near-field scanning to validate predicted emission patterns.
