# C2 Cross Sections, Sources & Detectors — Book Suggestions

Scattering cross sections and detector response connect emitted fields to measurable signals. These resources link theory, experiments, and instrumentation across wave domains.

## Scattering Theory Foundations
- *Scattering Theory of Waves and Particles* — Roger G. Newton. Provides partial-wave expansions, phase shifts, and cross-section derivations.
- *Light Scattering by Small Particles* — H.C. van de Hulst. Explains Mie theory, Rayleigh limits, and resonance phenomena for optical scattering.

## Source & Target Modeling
- *Introduction to Radar Systems* — Merrill I. Skolnik. Covers radar cross sections, target signatures, and transmitter design strategies.
- *Ultrasonic Scattering in Biological Tissues* — Fillippo S. Passoni & Stephen A. Goss. Demonstrates acoustic cross-section modeling relevant to medical imaging.

## Detection & Data Processing
- *Statistical Optics* — Joseph W. Goodman. Treats detector noise, responsivity, and coherence effects that shape measured scattering signals.
- *Principles of Nuclear Radiation Detection* — William Leo. Introduces detector efficiency, solid angle coverage, and counting statistics for particle and gamma detection.
