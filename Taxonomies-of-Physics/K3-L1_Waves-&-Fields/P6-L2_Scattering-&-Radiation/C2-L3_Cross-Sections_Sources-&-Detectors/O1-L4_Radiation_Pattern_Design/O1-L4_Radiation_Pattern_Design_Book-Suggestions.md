# O1 Radiation Pattern Design — Book Suggestions

These books focus on tailoring radiation patterns through array synthesis, aperture shaping, and optimization.

## Array Synthesis
- *Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design* — Constantine A. Balanis. Provides classical pattern synthesis methods including Dolph–Chebyshev and Taylor distributions.
- *Phased Array Antenna Handbook* — Robert C. Hansen. Offers practical design workflows for electronically steered arrays with pattern control.

## Aperture and Lens Techniques
- *Reflectarray Antennas* — John Huang & Jorge A. Encinar. Discusses phase-tuned surfaces that mold aperture phase for custom beams.
- *Modern Lens Antennas for Communications Engineering* — Walter M. Salazar-Palma et al. Covers beam shaping through graded-index and quasi-optical lens designs.

## Optimization and Measurement
- *Optimization Methods for Antenna Arrays* — Athanasios G. Kanatas & Peter D. M. Rollet. Presents genetic algorithms, convex optimization, and machine learning approaches for pattern synthesis.
- *Antenna and EM Modeling with MATLAB* — Sergey N. Makarov. Provides computational recipes to evaluate and refine designed patterns before prototyping.
