# O2 Scattering Signatures and Inversion — Book Suggestions

These references emphasize extracting material or geometric information from measured scattering signatures via inverse methods.

## Inverse Scattering Theory
- *Inverse Acoustic and Electromagnetic Scattering Theory* — David Colton & Rainer Kress. Presents uniqueness, stability, and reconstruction algorithms for inverse problems.
- *Linear and Nonlinear Inverse Problems with Practical Applications* — Jennifer Mueller & Samuli Siltanen. Offers regularization and numerical strategies for ill-posed scattering inversions.

## Radar and Remote Sensing
- *Introduction to the Space-Time Processing of Radar Signals* — Giuliano Giunta & Leonhard M. Reindl. Covers synthetic-aperture radar signatures and inversion workflows.
- *Optical Remote Sensing of Ocean and Coastal Waters* — ZhongPing Lee. Demonstrates how multispectral scattering signatures recover water constituents and depth.

## Tomography and Imaging
- *Diffuse Optical Tomography* — Hamid Dehghani & Simon R. Arridge. Explains inverse scattering in turbid media using finite element models.
- *Microwave Imaging and Sensing* — Sergey N. Makarov & Paul M. Meaney. Provides case studies of breast cancer detection and concealed object imaging via inverse scattering.
