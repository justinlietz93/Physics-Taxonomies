# O2 Group-vs-Phase Speed — Book Suggestions

Understanding the difference between group and phase velocity is essential for signal fidelity. These books emphasize analytic tools and experiments that reveal both speeds.

## Conceptual Overviews
- *Waves in Physics* — Julio V. García. Provides intuitive discussions and plots comparing phase advance to energy transport in dispersive media.
- *Vibrations and Waves* — H. J. Pain. Includes worked problems highlighting when group and phase speeds diverge and how that affects beats and envelopes.

## Advanced Treatments
- *Nonlinear Fiber Optics* — Govind P. Agrawal. Discusses group-velocity dispersion, higher-order terms, and their impact on pulse propagation in optical fibers.
- *Wave Propagation in Elastic Solids* — Jan Achenbach. Details dispersion relations and energy transport in elastic media, contrasting phase and group velocities for different modes.

## Experimental Perspectives
- *Ultrashort Laser Pulse Phenomena* — Jean-Claude Diels & Wolfgang Rudolph. Demonstrates autocorrelation and FROG measurements that map group delays in optics labs.
- *Seismic Wave Propagation in Stratified Media* — Brian L. N. Kennett. Shows how dispersion analysis of seismograms separates phase arrivals from group envelopes.
