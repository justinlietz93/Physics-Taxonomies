# O1 Material-Dispersion Curves — Book Suggestions

These texts focus on measuring and modeling how materials bend frequency–wave-number relations, providing the dispersion curves needed for design work.

## Foundational Theory
- *Solid State Physics* — Neil W. Ashcroft & N. David Mermin. Develops phonon dispersion and dielectric response models that form the archetype for frequency-dependent travel.
- *Principles of Optics* — Max Born & Emil Wolf. Presents Sellmeier equations, normal vs anomalous dispersion, and refractive-index tensors for optical materials.

## Measurement Techniques
- *Optical Properties of Solids* — Mark Fox. Describes ellipsometry, reflectometry, and absorption spectroscopy used to extract dispersion curves across wide spectral ranges.
- *Wave Propagation in Periodic Structures* — Léon Brillouin. Connects band-structure measurements with dispersion relations in photonic and phononic crystals.

## Data and Engineering Handbooks
- *Handbook of Optics, Vol. II* — Michael Bass et al. Provides tabulated refractive indices, Sellmeier coefficients, and dispersion equations for glasses and crystals.
- *Acoustic Wave and Electromechanical Resonators* — Humberto Campanella. Supplies dispersion data and equivalent-circuit models for piezoelectric and acoustic filter materials.
