# C1 Frequency-Dependent Travel — Book Suggestions

Dispersive media let different colors or notes travel at different speeds. These references explain the physics that sends pulses spreading or reshaping as they move.

## Foundational Treatments
- *Waves in Layered Media* — Leonid Brekhovskikh. Establishes the dispersion relation viewpoint for stratified acoustic and elastic materials.
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John D. Jackson. Presents dispersion in dielectrics and plasmas through constitutive relations and complex permittivity.

## Pulse Dynamics
- *Nonlinear Fiber Optics* — Govind P. Agrawal. Examines group velocity dispersion and higher-order effects governing optical pulse evolution.
- *Theory of Sound* — John William Strutt (Lord Rayleigh). Provides early, still-relevant analyses of dispersive propagation in pipes, plates, and bars.

## Measurement & Applications
- *Ultrashort Laser Pulse Phenomena* — Jean-Claude Diels & Wolfgang Rudolph. Covers experimental techniques for measuring and compensating dispersion in optics.
- *Ocean Acoustics: Propagation, Noise, and Reverberation* — William M. Carey & Richard B. Evans. Explores frequency-dependent travel in the ocean sound channel and its navigation implications.
