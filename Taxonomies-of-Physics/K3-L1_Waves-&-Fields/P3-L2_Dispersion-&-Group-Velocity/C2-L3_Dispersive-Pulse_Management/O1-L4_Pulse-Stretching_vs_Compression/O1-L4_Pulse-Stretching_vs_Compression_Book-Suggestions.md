# O1 Pulse-Stretching vs Compression — Book Suggestions

These references address how dispersion and nonlinearities stretch or compress pulses, highlighting design methods for shaping temporal envelopes.

## Foundations of Pulse Shaping
- *Ultrashort Laser Pulse Phenomena* — Jean-Claude Diels & Wolfgang Rudolph. Explains grating pairs, prism compressors, and chirped-pulse amplification workflows.
- *Nonlinear Fiber Optics* — Govind P. Agrawal. Covers dispersion-managed fiber designs and soliton-based compression strategies.

## Engineering Toolkits
- *Femtosecond Laser Pulses: Principles and Experiments* — Claude Rullière (ed.). Presents laboratory techniques for measuring and correcting dispersion using autocorrelators and pulse shapers.
- *Fourier Transform Spectrometry* — G. G. Neville & B. Stuart. Discusses phase retrieval and spectral filtering tools that underpin programmable pulse shaping.

## Applications and Case Studies
- *Chirped Pulse Amplification* — Donna Strickland (PhD thesis). Provides detailed design logic for stretching, amplifying, and recompressing high-intensity pulses.
- *Mode-Locked Laser Engineering* — Chunlei Guo & Wei Zhao. Demonstrates how intracavity dispersion control balances stretching and compression in ultrafast sources.
