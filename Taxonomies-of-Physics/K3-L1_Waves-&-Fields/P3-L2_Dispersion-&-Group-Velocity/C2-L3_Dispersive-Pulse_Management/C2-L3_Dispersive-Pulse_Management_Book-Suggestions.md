# C2 Dispersive Pulse Management — Book Suggestions

Managing dispersion keeps pulses short, bright, and synchronized after long journeys. These guides show how compensation, shaping, and nonlinear tricks reclaim pulse fidelity.

## Compensation Strategies
- *Dispersion Compensation in Optical Fiber Transmission Systems* — Stefan Pachnicke. Summarizes fiber links, dispersion maps, and practical compensator designs.
- *Fiber-Optic Communication Systems* — Govind P. Agrawal. Covers dispersion management, amplifier spacing, and digital signal processing for modern telecom networks.

## Pulse Shaping & Control
- *Ultrafast Optics* — Andrew Weiner. Explores spatial light modulators, pulse shapers, and Fourier-domain techniques to sculpt temporal profiles.
- *Femtosecond Laser Pulses* — Claude Rulliere (ed.). Describes compressor designs, prism pairs, and chirped mirrors used to tailor ultrashort pulses.

## Cross-Disciplinary Applications
- *Chirped Pulse Amplification* — Gérard Mourou, Donna Strickland & Toshiki Tajima. Provides historical context and engineering insights on stretching, amplifying, and recompressing pulses.
- *Medical Laser Physics* — Thomas F. Deutsch. Shows how dispersion management enables precise tissue ablation and imaging in biomedical devices.
