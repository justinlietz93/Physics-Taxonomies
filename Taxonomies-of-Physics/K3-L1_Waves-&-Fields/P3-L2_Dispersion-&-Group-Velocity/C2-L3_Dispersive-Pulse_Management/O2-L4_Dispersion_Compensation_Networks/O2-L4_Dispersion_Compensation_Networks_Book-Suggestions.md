# O2 Dispersion Compensation Networks — Book Suggestions

These resources explain how cascaded components cancel dispersion across communication links and laser systems.

## Communication Systems
- *Fiber-Optic Communication Systems* — Govind P. Agrawal. Details dispersion-compensating fiber, chirped Bragg gratings, and electronic equalization in long-haul links.
- *Optical Fiber Communications* — Gerd Keiser. Provides system-level design examples balancing dispersion maps, amplifiers, and nonlinear penalties.

## Microwave and Acoustic Networks
- *Microwave Engineering* — David M. Pozar. Covers all-pass networks, phase equalizers, and filter synthesis for group-delay control in RF systems.
- *Surface Acoustic Wave Devices in Telecommunications* — Colin Campbell. Shows how multi-section SAW filters compensate dispersion in radio front ends.

## Design and Optimization
- *Design of Optical Interleavers and Dispersion Compensators* — Yasuhiro Takushima & Kiyoshi Kikuchi. Discusses multi-element interferometers for broadband dispersion tailoring.
- *Digital Communications: A Discrete-Time Approach* — Michael Rice. Presents adaptive equalization and signal-processing strategies that electronically reverse channel dispersion.
