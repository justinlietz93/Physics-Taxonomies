# O2 Mode-Spectra Resonance — Book Suggestions

These references explain how to catalog mode spectra, measure resonance peaks, and extract quality factors across mechanical, acoustic, and electromagnetic resonators.

## Spectral Analysis Foundations
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Covers modal analysis, frequency response functions, and experimental modal testing techniques.
- *Fundamentals of Acoustics* — Lawrence E. Kinsler et al. Details normal-mode expansions, spectral lines, and damping identification in acoustic cavities.

## Electromagnetic Resonators
- *Field Theory of Guided Waves* — Robert E. Collin. Discusses eigenmode spectra in resonant cavities and waveguides, including degeneracies and perturbations.
- *Optical Resonators* — Norman Hodgson & Horst Weber. Provides longitudinal and transverse mode structures, frequency spacing, and linewidth control in laser cavities.

## Measurement and Diagnostics
- *Experimental Modal Analysis* — Ewins D. J. L. Offers procedures for extracting mode shapes and damping from measured spectra using impact and shaker tests.
- *Microwave Measurements* — E. L. Ginzton. Presents cavity perturbation, network-analyzer techniques, and resonance curve fitting for high-frequency systems.
