# F2-L5_Node-Antinode_Choreography — Family Index
**Definition:** Tracks how node and antinode placement shifts when boundaries move, bend, or combine different fixes.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Genus (L6) — index
- **G1-L6_Mode-Shape_Mapping** — visual tools that show how nodes slide as endpoints shift.
- **G2-L6_Transition-Boundary_Demos** — setups that swap between boundary types to highlight mode jumps.
