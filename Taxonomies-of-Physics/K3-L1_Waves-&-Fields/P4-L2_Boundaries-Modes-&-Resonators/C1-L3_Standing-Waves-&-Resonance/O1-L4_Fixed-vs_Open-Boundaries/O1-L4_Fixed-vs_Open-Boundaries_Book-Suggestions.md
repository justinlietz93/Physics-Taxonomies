# O1 Fixed-vs Open Boundaries — Book Suggestions

These texts examine how boundary conditions in strings, air columns, and cavities dictate allowed modes and resonance patterns.

## Foundational Treatments
- *The Physics of Vibrations and Waves* — H. J. Pain. Derives standing-wave solutions for fixed, free, and mixed boundary conditions in rods and membranes.
- *Fundamentals of Acoustics* — Lawrence E. Kinsler et al. Covers closed vs open tubes, impedance terminations, and the resulting harmonic series.

## Resonator Design Guides
- *Microwave Engineering* — David M. Pozar. Discusses cavity resonators, waveguide terminations, and quality factors for metallic enclosures.
- *Optical Resonators* — Norman Hodgson & Horst Weber. Details mirror boundary conditions, stability criteria, and mode structures in laser cavities.

## Experimental Perspectives
- *Vibrations and Waves in Physics* — Iain G. Main. Provides laboratory exercises comparing boundary setups and measuring mode frequencies.
- *Acoustics: An Introduction to Its Physical Principles and Applications* — Allan D. Pierce. Offers practical methods for tailoring boundary impedance to control resonances in rooms and ducts.
