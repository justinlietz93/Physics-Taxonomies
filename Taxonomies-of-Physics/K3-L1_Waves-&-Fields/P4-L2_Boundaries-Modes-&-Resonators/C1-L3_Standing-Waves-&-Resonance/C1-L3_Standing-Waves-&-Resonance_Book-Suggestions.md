# C1 Standing Waves & Resonance — Book Suggestions

Boundaries transform traveling waves into standing patterns that ring at discrete frequencies. These references cover resonance formation, mode counting, and damping across media.

## Fundamental Guides
- *Mechanical Vibrations* — Singiresu S. Rao. Explains standing waves, normal modes, and resonance curves for strings, rods, and plates.
- *Electromagnetic Waves and Antennas* — Sophocles J. Orfanidis. Introduces cavity and transmission-line resonances relevant to RF systems.

## Analytical Methods
- *Theory of Elasticity* — Landau & Lifshitz. Provides eigenmode solutions for solids with various boundary conditions, extending standing-wave concepts to continua.
- *Field Theory of Guided Waves* — Robert E. Collin. Derives resonant modes in waveguides and cavities with full vector rigor.

## Experimental & Design Perspectives
- *The Art of Electronics* — Horowitz & Hill. Offers practical resonance tuning and Q-factor measurement techniques in circuits.
- *Acoustics: Sound Fields and Transducers* — Beranek & Mellow. Connects standing waves in enclosures with loudspeaker and room design practice.
