# C1-L3_Standing-Waves-&-Resonance — Class Index
**Definition:** Explains how reflections and geometry lock waves into stationary nodes and antinodes with boosted amplitude.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Order (L4) — index
- **O1-L4_Fixed-vs_Open-Boundaries** — comparing node patterns for clamped ends versus free ends.
- **O2-L4_Mode-Spectra_Resonance** — scanning which frequencies fit and how resonance peaks appear.
