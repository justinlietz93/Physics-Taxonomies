# O1 Cavity-Shape Tailoring — Book Suggestions

These resources explore how modifying cavity geometry sculpts mode spectra, field distributions, and coupling for tailored resonators.

## Electromagnetic Cavities
- *Field Theory of Guided Waves* — Robert E. Collin. Provides eigenvalue methods for cavities with arbitrary cross-sections and perturbation techniques for shape tuning.
- *Optical Resonators* — Norman Hodgson & Horst Weber. Discusses stable resonator design, mirror curvatures, and higher-order transverse modes shaped by cavity geometry.

## Acoustic and Mechanical Cavities
- *Acoustics of Small Rooms* — Mendel Kleiner & Jiri Tichy. Shows how wall geometry, diffusers, and absorbers tailor modal densities and decay profiles.
- *Vibration of Plates and Shells* — Werner Soedel. Analyzes how curvature and boundary shapes modify mode frequencies and nodal patterns in mechanical cavities.

## Computational Design
- *Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method* — Allen Taflove & Susan C. Hagness. Offers numerical approaches for simulating cavity shape variations.
- *Topology Optimization in Structural and Continuum Mechanics* — Martin Philip Bendsoe & Ole Sigmund. Provides optimization frameworks for sculpting resonator shapes to achieve desired spectra.
