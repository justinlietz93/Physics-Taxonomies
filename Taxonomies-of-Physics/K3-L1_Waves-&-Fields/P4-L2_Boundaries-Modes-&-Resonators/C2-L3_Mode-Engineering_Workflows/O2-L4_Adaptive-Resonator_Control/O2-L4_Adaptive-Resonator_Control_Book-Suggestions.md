# O2 Adaptive-Resonator Control — Book Suggestions

These books and references show how feedback, tunable materials, and active elements adjust resonant behavior in real time.

## Feedback and Control Foundations
- *Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems* — Gene F. Franklin, J. David Powell & Abbas Emami-Naeini. Provides control design tools for locking resonance frequency, amplitude, and phase.
- *Adaptive Filters: Theory and Applications* — Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny. Explains algorithms like LMS and RLS that retune resonator responses based on streaming data.

## Tunable Resonator Technologies
- *RF MEMS: Theory, Design, and Technology* — Gabriel M. Rebeiz. Covers MEMS-tunable capacitors and inductors for agile RF resonators.
- *Ferroelectric Devices* — Kenji Uchino. Details electric-field-controlled permittivity changes for microwave and acoustic resonator tuning.

## Photonic and Acoustic Implementations
- *Silicon Photonics: Design from Devices to Systems* — Lukas Chrostowski & Michael Hochberg. Discusses thermo-optic and carrier-injection tuning of micro-ring resonators.
- *Adaptive Signal Processing with Applications to Communications* — Tülay Adali & Simon Haykin. Provides case studies on adaptive notch filters and resonator-based interference suppression.
