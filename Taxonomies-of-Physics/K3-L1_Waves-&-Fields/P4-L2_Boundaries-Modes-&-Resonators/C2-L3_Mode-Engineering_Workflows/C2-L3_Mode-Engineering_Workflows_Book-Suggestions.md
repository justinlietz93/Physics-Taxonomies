# C2 Mode Engineering Workflows — Book Suggestions

Mode engineering tunes boundary shapes and materials so resonators deliver the exact field profiles designers need. These books blend numerical design, fabrication, and measurement know-how.

## Design Frameworks
- *Photonic Crystal Cavities* — Kartik Srinivasan & Paul Barclay (eds.). Details simulation and optimization strategies for engineered optical modes.
- *Microwave Engineering Using Comsol* — Mehrdad Mehdizadeh. Walks through finite-element workflows for tailoring RF cavity resonances and field uniformity.

## Fabrication & Implementation
- *Integrated Photonics* — Graham T. Reed & Andrew P. Knights. Covers lithographic processes and design rules for guiding and confining optical modes on chips.
- *MEMS Vibrations: Analysis and Design* — Nicolae Lobontiu. Bridges microfabrication steps with desired mechanical mode shapes and frequencies.

## Diagnostics & Control
- *Field Mapping in Microwave Cavities* — Richard Carter. Surveys perturbation, bead-pull, and near-field scanning methods to verify engineered modes.
- *Optomechanical Systems Engineering* — Keith J. Kasunic. Explains alignment, metrology, and feedback techniques that keep tailored modes locked to specification.
