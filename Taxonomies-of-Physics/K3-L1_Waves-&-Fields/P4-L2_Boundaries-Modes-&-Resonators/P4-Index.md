# P4–L2 Boundaries, Modes & Resonators
**Definition:** Explores how wave patterns lock to shapes and how boundaries set the allowed tones or hotspots.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- **C1-L3_Standing-Waves-&-Resonance** — how reflections build stationary patterns and amplify select frequencies.
- **C2-L3_Mode-Engineering_Workflows** — how designers tweak structures and feedback to steer resonant modes on demand.
