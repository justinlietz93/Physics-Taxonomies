# K3 Waves & Fields — Core Equations

Waves and fields describe how disturbances and influences spread. These kingdom-level relations highlight the shared structure linking vibrations, interference, and radiation across the phyla.

## Wave Propagation
- **Scalar wave equation:** \(\nabla^{2} \psi - \frac{1}{v^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2} \psi}{\partial t^{2}} = 0\). The field \(\psi\) evolves so that spatial curvature \(\nabla^{2} \psi\) balances the second time derivative scaled by the propagation speed \(v\).
- **Plane-wave solution:** \(\psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = A e^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r} - \omega t)}\). Amplitude \(A\), wavevector \(\mathbf{k}\), and angular frequency \(\omega\) encode direction, wavelength \(\lambda = 2\pi/|\mathbf{k}|\), and period \(T = 2\pi/\omega\).
- **Dispersion relation (generic):** \(\omega = \omega(\mathbf{k})\). Frequency depends on wavevector according to the medium or field equation; group velocity is \(\mathbf{v}_{g} = \nabla_{\mathbf{k}} \omega\).

## Interference & Energy
- **Superposition principle:** \(\psi_{\text{total}} = \sum_{n} \psi_{n}\). Linear media sum contributions from each wave component, setting up interference patterns.
- **Intensity from amplitude:** \(I \propto |\psi|^{2}\). Wave intensity scales with the square magnitude of the field amplitude, linking energy flow to observable brightness or loudness.
- **Poynting-like energy flux:** \(\mathbf{S} = u \mathbf{v}_{g}\). Energy density \(u\) carried by waves flows along the group velocity, generalizing the electromagnetic Poynting vector.

## Boundaries & Resonance
- **Reflection/transmission coefficients:** \(R + T = 1\). Fractional energy reflectance \(R\) and transmittance \(T\) sum to unity for lossless interfaces.
- **Standing-wave condition:** \(k_{n} = \tfrac{n \pi}{L}\). In cavities of size \(L\) with fixed boundaries, only discrete wave numbers \(k_{n}\) fit, indexing resonant modes by integer \(n\).
- **Quality factor:** \(Q = 2\pi \times \frac{\text{energy stored}}{\text{energy lost per cycle}}\). The dimensionless \(Q\) gauges sharpness of resonance and foreshadows damping analyses.

## Field Concepts
- **Field source law (generic Poisson form):** \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \rho/\epsilon\). Sources with density \(\rho\) generate field divergence scaled by a medium constant \(\epsilon\), unifying electrostatics, gravity, and acoustics analogs.
- **Wave impedance:** \(Z = \frac{\text{field strength}}{\text{field flux}}\). Matching impedance across media controls reflections and energy transmission.
- **Lagrangian density for fields:** \(\mathcal{L} = T(\dot{\psi}) - V(\nabla \psi, \psi)\). Field theories balance kinetic \(T\) and potential \(V\) terms; Euler–Lagrange variation reproduces the wave equation.

These relations emphasize how waveform structure, interference, and boundary constraints interplay—setting the stage for the specialized phyla on propagation, dispersion, and nonlinear behavior.
