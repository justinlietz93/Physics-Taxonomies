# K3–L1 Waves & Fields
**Definition:** Explains how disturbances travel, interact, and carry energy or information through space and media.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phyla (L2) — index
- **P1-L2_Wave-Kinematics-&-Propagation** — speeds, amplitudes, and directions of traveling disturbances.
- **P2-L2_Interference-&-Diffraction** — overlapping waves creating fringes and shadow patterns.
- **P3-L2_Dispersion-&-Group-Velocity** — frequency-dependent travel that separates colors or tones.
- **P4-L2_Boundaries-Modes-&-Resonators** — standing patterns set by geometry and constraints.
- **P5-L2_Nonlinear-Waves-&-Solitons** — self-steepening pulses and shock-like fronts.
- **P6-L2_Scattering-&-Radiation** — how sources emit and how obstacles redirect wave energy.

## Native questions
- What sets the speed, shape, or direction of the disturbance?
- How do overlapping waves add up or cancel in different locations?
- Which features survive or change when the wave meets a boundary or new medium?

## Everyday anchors
- Surf waves rolling to shore and reshaping as depth changes.
- Sound from speakers filling a room and bending around corners.
- Rainbows and radio broadcasts showing dispersion and radiation.
