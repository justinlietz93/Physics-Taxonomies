# Waves & Fields (how influence travels)

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phylum

- **Kinematics of Waves** — speed, wavelength, superposition; *ripples, sound*.
- **Interference & Diffraction** — patterns from overlap; *soap-film colors*.
- **Dispersion & Group Velocity** — different sizes travel differently; *ocean swells*.
- **Boundaries, Modes & Resonators** — standing patterns; *guitar strings, rooms*.
- **Nonlinear Waves & Solitons** — self-shaping pulses; *tsunami-like packets*.
- **Scattering & Radiation** — sending/redirecting waves; *echoes, radar*.
