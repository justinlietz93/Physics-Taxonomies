# Title

**Definition**: Plain language definition goes here, using a Analogic-First Constructivist learning style for me.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phylum

- Phylum items go here

## Class (canonical models)

- Only populate down to the child items, example: If this is an index for Mechanics, you would only add items to the Phylum above and no lower, if this was Energy Landscapes & Variational Principles, you would only go down to Class. Later once everything is defined we will come back and finish the rest.

## Order (regimes/approximations)

## Family (canonical problems)

## Species (everyday exemplars)
