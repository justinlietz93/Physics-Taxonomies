# O1 Straight-Conductor Fields — Book Suggestions

These works cover the magnetostatic fundamentals for long conductors, a stepping stone to coils and complex windings.

## Conceptual Foundations
- *Introduction to Electrodynamics* — David J. Griffiths. Clear derivations of Biot–Savart fields and Ampère’s law for straight currents.
- *Electricity and Magnetism* — Edward M. Purcell & David J. Morin. Builds physical intuition for the symmetry arguments behind wire fields and forces.

## Power Engineering Context
- *Power System Electromagnetic Fields* — Fouad E. Abdel-Fattah. Applies line-current field models to busbars, switchgear, and substation layouts.
- *Transmission Line Design Manual* — Holland H. Farr. Uses classic formulas for wire fields, sag, and spacing to meet utility standards.

## Practice and Design Tools
- *Schaum's Outline of Electromagnetics* — Joseph A. Edminister. Extensive problems on wire fields, inductance per length, and mutual forces.
- *Magnetic Design of Power Supplies* — Lloyd H. Dixon Jr. Explains how straight conductor models inform winding placement and mechanical bracing.
