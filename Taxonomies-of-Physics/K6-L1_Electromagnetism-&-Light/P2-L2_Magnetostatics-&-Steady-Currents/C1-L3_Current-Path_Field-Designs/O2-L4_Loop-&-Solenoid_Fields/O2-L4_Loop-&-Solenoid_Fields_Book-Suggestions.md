# O2 Loop & Solenoid Fields — Book Suggestions

These titles show how circular conductors and solenoids shape magnetic fields for sensing, actuation, and energy storage.

## Fundamental Treatments
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John David Jackson. Derives on-axis loop fields, multipole expansions, and finite-solenoid corrections.
- *Introduction to Electrodynamics* — David J. Griffiths. Pedagogical coverage of Ampère’s law and Biot–Savart integrals for loops and coils.

## Coil Design Guides
- *Inductors: Design, Analysis, and Applications* — Clayton R. Paul. Bridges analytical field formulas with practical winding choices and core selections.
- *Coil Design and Construction Manual* — Paul N. Winfield. Hands-on instructions for winding solenoids, air-core magnets, and RF loops.

## Measurement & Applications
- *Magnetic Measurements and Magnetometers* — Pavel Ripka. Explores how loop field formulas support fluxgate, search-coil, and gradient sensors.
- *Electromagnetic Actuators and Sensors* — Shyam K. Seshadri. Applies solenoid field relations to linear actuators and relays with performance tuning tips.
