# O1 Core-Materials & Shapes — Book Suggestions

These books emphasize how core geometry and permeability choices channel flux in magnetic circuits.

## Material Behavior
- *Magnetic Materials: Fundamentals and Device Applications* — Nicola A. Spaldin. Explains B–H curves, saturation, and loss mechanisms for soft magnetic alloys.
- *Soft Ferrites: Properties and Applications* — E.C. Snelling. Deep dive on ferrite compositions, permeability spectra, and temperature behavior.

## Circuit Design Frameworks
- *Magnetic Circuits and Transformers* — MIT Staff. Classic treatment linking MMF, reluctance networks, and core shaping for transformers and reactors.
- *Inductor Design Handbook* — Colonel Wm. T. McLyman. Practical guidance on selecting core shapes, stacking, and gaps to meet inductance targets.

## Engineering References
- *Handbook of Transformer Design and Applications* — William M. Flanagan. Applies magnetic circuit equations to laminated cores and power devices.
- *Design of Brushless Permanent-Magnet Motors* — J.R. Hendershot & T.J.E. Miller. Shows how stator and rotor core shapes control flux paths and torque production.
