# C1 Changing Field Playbooks — Book Suggestions

Time-varying fields drive induction, radiation, and wave phenomena. These references supply Maxwellian intuition, transient analysis, and practical playbooks for changing fields.

## Maxwell Foundations
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John D. Jackson. Derives time-dependent Maxwell equations, retarded potentials, and radiation.
- *Electromagnetic Fields and Waves* — Paul Lorrain & Dale Corson. Provides step-by-step transient field examples.

## Induction & Transients
- *Electromagnetic Transients in Power Systems* — Allan Greenwood. Addresses switching, lightning, and surge phenomena.
- *Transient Electromagnetics* — Yue Li & Xun Gong. Offers analytical and numerical methods for pulsed fields.

## Measurement & Simulation
- *Time-Domain Electromagnetics* — Ulrich R. Pfeiffer. Discusses finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) techniques for evolving fields.
- *Near-Field Characterization of Electric and Magnetic Fields* — Tomasz Tarnowski. Provides instrumentation guides for mapping changing fields.
