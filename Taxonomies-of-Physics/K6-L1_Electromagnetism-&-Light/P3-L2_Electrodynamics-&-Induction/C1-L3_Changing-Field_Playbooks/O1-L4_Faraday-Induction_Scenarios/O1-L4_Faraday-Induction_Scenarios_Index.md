# O1-L4_Faraday-Induction_Scenarios — Order Index
**Definition:** Situations where moving conductors or magnets create voltages and loops by changing magnetic flux.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- F1-L5_Moving-Flux_Loops — rotate or slide conductors through field lines to source current.
- F2-L5_Time-Varying_Field_Shields — watch how ramping fields induce opposition and drag.
