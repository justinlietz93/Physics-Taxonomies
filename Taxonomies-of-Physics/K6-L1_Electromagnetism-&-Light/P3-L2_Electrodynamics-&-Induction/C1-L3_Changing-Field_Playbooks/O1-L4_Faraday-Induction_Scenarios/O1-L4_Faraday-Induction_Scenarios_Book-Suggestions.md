# O1 Faraday-Induction Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These references focus on the physics and applications of Faraday induction in moving conductors and time-varying magnetic fields.

## Core Theory
- *Electricity and Magnetism* — Edward M. Purcell & David J. Morin. Builds Faraday’s law from relativity arguments and demonstrates induced EMF experiments.
- *Introduction to Electrodynamics* — David J. Griffiths. Thorough derivations of both integral and differential forms of Faraday’s law with worked examples.

## Applications & Devices
- *Electromechanical Motion Devices* — Paul C. Krause, Oleg Wasynczuk & Scott D. Sudhoff. Applies induction concepts to generators, motors, and railguns.
- *Principles of Electromechanical Energy Conversion* — G. R. Slemon. Links induced voltage expressions to torque production and energy flow.

## Laboratory & Project Guides
- *Experimental Electromagnetism* — Antonio García-Beltrán & José M. Paredes. Hands-on experiments that visualize changing-flux scenarios and motional EMF.
- *Make: Electronics* — Charles Platt. Practical builds including induction heaters, generators, and magnetic braking demonstrations.
