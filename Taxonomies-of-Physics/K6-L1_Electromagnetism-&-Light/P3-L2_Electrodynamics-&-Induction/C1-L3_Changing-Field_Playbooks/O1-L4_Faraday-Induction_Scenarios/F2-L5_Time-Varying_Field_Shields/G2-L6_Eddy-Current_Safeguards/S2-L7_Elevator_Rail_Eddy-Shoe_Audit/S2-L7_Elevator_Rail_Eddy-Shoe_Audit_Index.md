# S2-L7_Elevator_Rail_Eddy-Shoe_Audit — Species Index
**Definition:** Verify induced-damping shoes on high-rise elevators keep cars smooth during emergency stops.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Describe how braking magnets cut field lines to develop eddy drag that backs up mechanical clamps.
- Stress regular gap measurements so induced damping stays consistent over seasonal rail expansion.
