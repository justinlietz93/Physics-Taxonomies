# C1-L3_Changing-Field_Playbooks — Class Index
**Definition:** Guides for spotting how time-varying flux induces voltages, currents, and field loops in practical setups.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Order (L4) — index
- O1-L4_Faraday-Induction_Scenarios — moving loops or magnets that turn changing flux into voltage.
- O2-L4_Displacement-Current_Linkages — when electric field changes behave like extra current paths.
