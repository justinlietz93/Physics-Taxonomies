# O2 Displacement-Current Linkages — Book Suggestions

These books clarify how Maxwell’s displacement current unifies circuit intuition with field continuity and wave propagation.

## Maxwell’s Synthesis
- *The Maxwellians* — Bruce J. Hunt. Historical narrative on how displacement current completed Maxwell’s equations.
- *Classical Electromagnetic Radiation* — Mark A. Heald & Jerry B. Marion. Detailed derivations of the Maxwell–Ampère law and electromagnetic wave emergence.

## Capacitors and Dielectrics
- *Fields and Waves in Communication Electronics* — Simon Ramo, John R. Whinnery & Theodore Van Duzer. Connects displacement current to capacitor behavior in RF systems.
- *Dielectrics in Electric Fields* — Gorur G. Raju. Examines polarization currents, displacement current density, and dielectric response times.

## Advanced Perspectives
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John David Jackson. Rigorous treatment of displacement current in boundary-value problems and radiation zones.
- *Electrodynamics of Continuous Media* — L.D. Landau, E.M. Lifshitz & L.P. Pitaevskii. Addresses displacement current within materials, including dispersive and anisotropic media.
