# C1 Changing Field Playbooks — Core Equations

Time-varying fields satisfy Maxwell’s curl equations and carry energy through space. These formulas capture induction, displacement current, and energy flow.

## Maxwell’s Curl Equations
**Faraday’s law:**

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$

- Changing magnetic fields induce electric fields, forming the basis of transformers and inductive sensors.

**Ampère–Maxwell law:**

$$\nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t}$$

- Displacement current term $\partial \mathbf{D} / \partial t$ enables self-consistent electromagnetic wave propagation.

## Induction Metrics
**Induced emf:**

$$\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}$$

- The electromotive force around a loop equals the negative rate of change of magnetic flux $\Phi_{B}$.

**Mutual inductance:**

$$M = \frac{\Phi_{21}}{I_{1}}$$

- Flux linkage $\Phi_{21}$ produced in coil 2 per current $I_{1}$ in coil 1 quantifies inductive coupling.

## Energy Flow
**Poynting vector:**

$$\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{H}$$

- Indicates electromagnetic power flow per unit area, essential for analyzing transients and wave propagation.

**Energy density:**

$$u = \tfrac{1}{2} (\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{H})$$

- Combines electric and magnetic energy storage, linking field dynamics to stored energy and radiation.
