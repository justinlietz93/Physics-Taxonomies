# C1 Field Mapping & Forces — Book Suggestions

Electrostatic fields shape forces and potential landscapes. These resources emphasize visualization, measurement, and analytical tools for field mapping.

## Foundational Texts
- *Introduction to Electrodynamics* — David J. Griffiths. Provides superposition, field mapping, and potential methods with intuitive explanations.
- *Classical Electromagnetism* — Jerrold Franklin. Offers worked boundary-value solutions and force calculations.

## Experimental & Visualization Tools
- *Field Mapping in Electrostatics* — John D. Kraus. Covers electrode design, equipotential plotting, and measurement apparatus.
- *Electric Field Mapping* — R.P. van der Walt & H. Strauss. Laboratory manual for mapping potentials and deducing field lines.

## Applications
- *Electrostatics* — John Melcher. Connects field mapping to dielectrophoresis, MEMS actuation, and particle manipulation.
- *Applied Electrostatics* — Joseph M. Crowley. Addresses force calculations in precipitators, coating, and instrumentation.
