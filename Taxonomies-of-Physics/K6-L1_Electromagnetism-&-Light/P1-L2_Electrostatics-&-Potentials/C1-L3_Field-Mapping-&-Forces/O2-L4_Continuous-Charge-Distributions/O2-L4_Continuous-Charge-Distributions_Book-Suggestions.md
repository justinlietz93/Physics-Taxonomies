# O2 Continuous-Charge Distributions — Book Suggestions

These references teach how to replace discrete charge counts with density functions and symmetry tricks suited to extended bodies.

## Core Texts
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John David Jackson. Rigorous integral formulations for volume, surface, and line charges with multipole expansions.
- *Electromagnetic Fields* — Roald Wangsness. Balanced coverage of Gauss’s law applications and analytic integrations for canonical geometries.

## Computational & Numerical Aids
- *Computational Electromagnetism* — Anders Bondeson, Thomas Rylander & Pär Ingelström. Shows how to discretize continuous distributions for finite-element solvers.
- *Electrostatics of Conductors & Dielectrics* — Akhlesh Lakhtakia. Connects continuous charge models with polarization and boundary-charge reconstruction.

## Worked Problems
- *Problems and Solutions on Electromagnetism* — Yung-Kuo Lim. Extensive solved examples on line, surface, and volume charge fields.
- *Schaum's Outline of Electromagnetics* — Joseph A. Edminister. Stepwise Gauss’s law and integral evaluations for high-symmetry charge distributions.
