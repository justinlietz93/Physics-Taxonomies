# S2-L7_Static-Safe_Workmat_Field-Map — Species Index
**Definition:** Check that grounded workmats keep near-zero fields above electronics assembly stations.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Sweep a field probe just above the mat to confirm the uniform near-zero field predicted by grounded sheet models.
- Show how lifted corners or worn spots break symmetry and raise risk, prompting maintenance or mat replacement.
