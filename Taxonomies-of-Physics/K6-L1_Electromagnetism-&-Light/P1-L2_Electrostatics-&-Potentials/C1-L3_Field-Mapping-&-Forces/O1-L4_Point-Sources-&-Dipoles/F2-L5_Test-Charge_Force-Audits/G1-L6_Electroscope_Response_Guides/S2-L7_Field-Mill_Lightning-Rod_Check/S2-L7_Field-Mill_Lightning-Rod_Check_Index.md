# S2-L7_Field-Mill_Lightning-Rod_Check — Species Index
**Definition:** Rotate a portable field mill beneath lightning rods to confirm safe field levels around rooftops.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Sweep the sensor around the mast to ensure grounded rods keep fields below spark thresholds.
- Document how weather humidity alters readings, guiding when maintenance teams recheck bonding straps.
