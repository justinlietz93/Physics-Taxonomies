# O1 Point-Sources & Dipoles — Book Suggestions

These texts build intuition for isolated charges and their dipole combinations before tackling extended charge maps.

## Foundations of Electrostatics
- *Introduction to Electrodynamics* — David J. Griffiths. Clear derivations of Coulomb forces, dipole expansions, and electric potential concepts.
- *Electricity and Magnetism* — Edward M. Purcell & David J. Morin. Uses relativity-informed reasoning to motivate fields of point sources and small dipoles.

## Visualization & Mapping Guides
- *Field Mapping and Electromagnetics* — Stanley V. Marshall. Practical methods for plotting equipotentials and field lines for point and dipole sources.
- *Electrostatics of Conductors and Dielectrics* — Akhlesh Lakhtakia. Bridges localized charge models to polarization response and measurement techniques.

## Problem Collections
- *Problems in Electromagnetism* — N.N. Konopleva & N.N. Popov. Targeted exercises on point charge interactions, multipole moments, and torque balances.
- *Schaum's Outline of Electromagnetics* — Joseph A. Edminister. Step-by-step worked problems on dipole potentials, field components, and superposition practice.
