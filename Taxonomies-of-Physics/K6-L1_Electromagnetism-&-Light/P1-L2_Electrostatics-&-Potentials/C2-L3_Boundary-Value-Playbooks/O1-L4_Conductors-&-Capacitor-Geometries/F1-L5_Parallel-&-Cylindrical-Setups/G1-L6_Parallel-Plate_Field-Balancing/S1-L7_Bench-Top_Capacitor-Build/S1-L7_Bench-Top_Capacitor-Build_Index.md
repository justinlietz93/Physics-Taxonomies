# S1-L7_Bench-Top_Capacitor-Build — Species Index
**Definition:** Stack aluminum foil and plastic sheets to hit a target capacitance for a DIY sensor or power filter.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Measure plate area, gap, and dielectric constant, then compute and test capacitance to see theory meet multimeter.
- Swap materials to show how field uniformity and losses shift the energy storage you can count on.
