# C2 Boundary Value Playbooks — Book Suggestions

Electrostatic boundary problems require tailored coordinate systems and expansions. These references provide separation-of-variables tricks, conformal maps, and Green’s functions.

## Analytical Techniques
- *Methods of Theoretical Physics* — Morse & Feshbach. Classic guide to separable coordinate systems and eigenfunction expansions.
- *Mathematical Methods for Physicists* — Arfken, Weber & Harris. Includes practical boundary-value recipes and special functions.

## Potential Theory
- *Electrostatics of Conductors and Dielectrics* — Roland Plonsey & Robert E. Collin. Focuses on Green’s functions and image methods.
- *Conformal Mapping* — Zeev Nehari. Provides mapping techniques that simplify two-dimensional boundary shapes.

## Applied Case Studies
- *Field Computation by Moment Methods* — Roger F. Harrington. Demonstrates numerical approaches when analytic playbooks fail.
- *Partial Differential Equations in Physics* — Arnold Sommerfeld. Showcases canonical boundary-value solutions in cylindrical and spherical geometries.
