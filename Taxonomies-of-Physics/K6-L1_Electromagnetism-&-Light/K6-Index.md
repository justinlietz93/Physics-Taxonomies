# K6–L1 Electromagnetism & Light
**Definition:** How electric charges, currents, and light share energy and information through space in everyday tech and nature.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phyla (L2) — index
- P1-L2_Electrostatics-&-Potentials — how fixed charges build fields and stored energy.
- P2-L2_Magnetostatics-&-Steady-Currents — how steady currents shape magnetic forces and circuits.
- P3-L2_Electrodynamics-&-Induction — how changing fields move energy and spark voltage on demand.
## Native questions
- How do charges rearrange to balance forces or store energy in familiar gear?
- When do steady currents tug, twist, or align tools around us?
- How do changing magnetic fields move power between coils, rooms, and satellites?
## Everyday anchors
- Balloon-on-wall stick tests, lightning rods, fridge magnets, speaker coils, factory power rails, magnetic phone mounts, induction cooktops, transformers, wireless charging pads, maglev stations.
