# Electromagnetism & Light (forces through space)

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phylum

- **Electrostatics** — charges, fields, potentials; *balloon on wall*.
- **Magnetostatics** — steady currents, magnets; *compasses, motors*.
- **Circuits (Lumped Models)** — resistors/caps/inductors as springs-and-masses; *amps*.
- **Maxwell Waves & Radiation** — light, antennas, EM propagation; *Wi-Fi, radio*.
- **Materials & EM Response** — dielectrics, conductors, optics; *lenses, metals*.
- **Waveguides, Cavities & Antennas** — shaping EM modes; *microwave ovens*.

## Class (canonical models)

- Circuits: DC; AC steady-state; Transients; Transmission lines.

## Order (regimes/approximations)

- Low vs high frequency; lumped vs distributed; weak vs strong coupling to atennas.

## Family (canonical problems)

- RC step response; RLC resonance; quarter-wave antenna; waveguide modes.

## Genus (L6)

_(Insert Genus folders `G*-L6_*` between Family and Species; each Genus contains several Species.)_

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars

- Phone charging brick (RC), guitar pickup + amp, microwave oven cavity mode, Wi-Fi router antenna.
