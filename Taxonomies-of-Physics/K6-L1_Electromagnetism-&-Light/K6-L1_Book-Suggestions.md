# K6 Electromagnetism & Light — Book Suggestions

Electromagnetism unifies fields, waves, and light. These references supply the shared theoretical and experimental base before diving into specialized phyla.

## Core Texts
- *Introduction to Electrodynamics* — David J. Griffiths. Balanced coverage of statics, dynamics, and radiation with intuitive derivations and worked examples.
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John D. Jackson. Rigorous treatment of Maxwell's equations, boundary value problems, and radiation in covariant form.

## Optical & Wave Perspectives
- *Optics* — Eugene Hecht. Bridges electromagnetic theory with ray, wave, and quantum optics, supporting branches on light-matter interaction.
- *Principles of Optics* — Max Born & Emil Wolf. Comprehensive reference on wave propagation, interference, and diffraction in complex media.

## Experimental & Applied Angles
- *Electromagnetic Fields and Energy* — Hermann A. Haus & James R. Melcher. Pairs field theory with physical intuition and laboratory contexts.
- *Foundations of Applied Electromagnetics* — Reza Zoughi & Peyman Nayeri. Highlights measurement techniques and modern applications that tie into sensing and photonics phyla.
