# C1 Spacetime Kinematics — Book Suggestions

Special relativity reshapes concepts of space and time. These resources develop Minkowski diagrams, Lorentz transformations, and simultaneity puzzles.

## Foundational Introductions
- *Spacetime Physics* — Edwin F. Taylor & John A. Wheeler. Accessible walkthrough of relativity kinematics with diagrams and problems.
- *Introduction to Special Relativity* — James H. Smith. Provides derivations and worked examples of Lorentz transformations and invariants.

## Geometric Perspectives
- *Special Relativity in General Frames* — Éric Gourgoulhon. Emphasizes four-vectors and tensor notation for modern applications.
- *A Traveler’s Guide to Spacetime* — Thomas A. Moore. Uses thought experiments and spacetime diagrams to illustrate kinematic effects.

## Experimental & Historical Context
- *Einstein’s Relativity and the Evolution of Physics* — Albert Einstein & Leopold Infeld. Historical insight into the conceptual shifts.
- *Time and Space* — Ilya Prigogine & Isabelle Stengers. Discusses philosophical implications and experimental confirmations of relativistic kinematics.
