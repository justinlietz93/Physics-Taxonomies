# G1-L6_Moving-Observer-Light-Flashes — Genus Index
**Definition:** Paired light pulses checked by riders and station keepers to show shifting simultaneity.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Train-Car_Light-Pulse-Demo — flashes from car center that riders call simultaneous, platform folks do not.
- S2-L7_Lightning-Strikes_Observer-Disagreement — storms where moving observers disagree on which strike came first.
