# C1 Spacetime Kinematics â€” Core Equations

Special relativity kinematics is governed by Lorentz transformations and invariant intervals. These equations describe time dilation, length contraction, and simultaneity shifts.

## Lorentz Transformation
**Boost along x-axis:**

$$\begin{aligned}
ct' &= \gamma (ct - \beta x), \\
x' &= \gamma (x - \beta ct), \\
y' &= y, \\
z' &= z
\end{aligned}$$

- Relates coordinates in frames moving at speed $v = \beta c$ with Lorentz factor $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - \beta^{2}}$.

**Spacetime interval:**

$$s^{2} = -c^{2} t^{2} + x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}$$

- Invariant quantity preserved by Lorentz transformations, classifying events as timelike, spacelike, or lightlike.

## Kinematic Effects
**Time dilation:**

$$\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t$$

- Moving clocks tick slower by factor $\gamma$ as seen from stationary frame.

**Length contraction:**

$$L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}$$

- Objects moving relative to observer contract along direction of motion.

## Velocity Addition
**Relativistic velocity addition:**

$$u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^{2}}}$$

- Combines velocities $u$ and $v$ ensuring resultant speed never exceeds $c$.

**Rapidity parameter:**

$$\eta = \tanh^{-1}(\beta)$$

- Additive parameter for successive boosts, simplifying kinematic compositions.
