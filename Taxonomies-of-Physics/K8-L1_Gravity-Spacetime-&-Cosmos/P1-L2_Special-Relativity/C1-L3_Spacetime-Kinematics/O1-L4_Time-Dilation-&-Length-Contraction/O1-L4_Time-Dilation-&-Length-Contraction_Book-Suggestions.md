# O1 Time-Dilation & Length-Contraction — Book Suggestions

These books build intuition for Lorentz transformations, time dilation experiments, and length contraction effects.

## Conceptual Foundations
- *Spacetime Physics* — Edwin F. Taylor & John Archibald Wheeler. Geometric explanation of time dilation and length contraction with spacetime diagrams.
- *Introduction to Special Relativity* — James H. Smith. Step-by-step derivations and problem sets on Lorentz kinematics.

## Experimental Perspectives
- *Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution* — Richard Wolfson. Accessible discussion of clock-comparison experiments and muon lifetime measurements.
- *Special Relativity in the Undergraduate Physics Curriculum* — Paul K. Townsend. Focuses on measurable consequences such as length contraction and time dilation in accelerators.

## Problem-Solving Resources
- *Special Relativity* — A.P. French. Classic text with numerous worked problems on velocity addition, simultaneity, and proper time.
- *Schaum's Outline of Relativity* — Murray R. Spiegel. Practice problems covering Lorentz transformations and invariant intervals.
