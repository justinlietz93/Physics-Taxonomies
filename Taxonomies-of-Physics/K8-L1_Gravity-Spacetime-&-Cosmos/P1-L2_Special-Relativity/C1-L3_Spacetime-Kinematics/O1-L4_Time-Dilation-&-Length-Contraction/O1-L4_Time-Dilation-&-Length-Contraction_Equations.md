# O1 Time-Dilation & Length-Contraction â€” Core Equations

Relative motion reshapes measurements of time and distance. These equations summarize Lorentz transformations, time dilation, and length contraction relationships.

## Lorentz Factor
**Definition:**

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}, \quad \beta = \frac{v}{c}$$

- Encodes velocity dependence for dilation and contraction formulas.

## Time Dilation
**Moving clock interval:**

$$\Delta t = \gamma \Delta \tau$$

- Relates coordinate time interval \(\Delta t\) measured in the lab frame to proper time \(\Delta \tau\) measured by the moving clock.

**Twin paradox travel time:**

$$\Delta \tau = \int \sqrt{1 - \beta^2(t)} \, dt$$

- Integrates instantaneous velocity to obtain proper time along accelerated journeys.

## Length Contraction
**Contracted length:**

$$L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}$$

- Connects rest length \(L_0\) of an object to measured length \(L\) in a frame where it moves at speed \(v\).

## Lorentz Transformation
**Time and space coordinates:**

$$t' = \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right), \qquad x' = \gamma (x - v t)$$

- Converts events between inertial frames moving at relative velocity \(v\) along the x-axis.

**Invariant interval:**

$$s^2 = c^2 \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 - \Delta y^2 - \Delta z^2$$

- Remains unchanged under Lorentz transformations, highlighting spacetime geometry.

## Relativistic Velocity Addition
**Velocity addition law:**

$$u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{u v}{c^2}}$$

- Ensures resulting speeds stay below \(c\) when transforming velocities between frames.
