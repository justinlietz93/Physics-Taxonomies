# O1 Momentum-Energy Tradeoffs — Book Suggestions

These works focus on relativistic energy-momentum relations, particle collisions, and accelerator kinematics.

## Core Dynamics
- *Introduction to Special Relativity* — Robert Resnick. Thorough coverage of four-momentum, energy-momentum invariants, and relativistic work-energy relations.
- *Spacetime and Geometry* — Sean M. Carroll. Early chapters on special relativistic dynamics with emphasis on four-vectors.

## Particle Physics Context
- *Introduction to Elementary Particles* — David Griffiths. Applies energy-momentum conservation to scattering, decays, and threshold calculations.
- *Classical and Quantum Dynamics of Relativistic Particles* — Riccardo Pucacco & Giuseppe V. Chicone. Explores relativistic Lagrangians, collisions, and invariants.

## Accelerator & Astrophysical Applications
- *Relativistic Kinematics* — Roberto A. Ricci & Carlo A. N. Biscari. Focused treatment on collider frame transformations, Mandelstam variables, and reaction thresholds.
- *High Energy Astrophysics* — Malcolm S. Longair. Uses relativistic energy-momentum relations to analyze cosmic rays and radiation processes.
