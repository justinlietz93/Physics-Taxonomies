# G1-L6_Beam-vs-Target-Setups — Genus Index
**Definition:** Contrasts two beams colliding head-on with one beam striking a resting target.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Large-Hadron-Collider_Chasing-Higgs — counter-rotating proton beams turning energy into new particles.
- S2-L7_Medical_Linac_Target-Strike — electron beams hitting metal to make X-rays for imaging.
