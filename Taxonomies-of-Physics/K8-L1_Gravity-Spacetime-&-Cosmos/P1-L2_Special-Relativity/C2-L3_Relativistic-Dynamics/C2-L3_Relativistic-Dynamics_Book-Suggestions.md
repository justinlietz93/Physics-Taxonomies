# C2 Relativistic Dynamics — Book Suggestions

Relativistic dynamics blends energy–momentum relations with force laws. These references discuss four-forces, collisions, and particle dynamics in fields.

## Core References
- *Classical Electrodynamics* — John D. Jackson. Provides relativistic particle dynamics and radiation reaction.
- *Relativity: The Special and General Theory* — Albert Einstein. Original exposition including energy–momentum relations.

## Particle Dynamics
- *Classical Mechanics* — Herbert Goldstein. Contains relativistic Lagrangians and Hamiltonians for particles.
- *Electrodynamics of Continuous Media* — Landau & Lifshitz. Discusses relativistic forces on charges and fluids.

## Applications
- *High Energy Astrophysics* — Malcolm S. Longair. Applies relativistic dynamics to cosmic rays and jets.
- *Accelerator Physics* — S.Y. Lee. Explores synchrotron motion, radiation, and beam dynamics in relativistic accelerators.
