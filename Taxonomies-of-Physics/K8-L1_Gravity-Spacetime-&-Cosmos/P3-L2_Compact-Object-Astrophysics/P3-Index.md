# P3–L2 Compact Object Astrophysics
**Definition:** Dense stellar leftovers—white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes—where gravity crushes matter into exotic states.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- C1-L3_Stellar-Remnant-Structure — balancing gravity and quantum pressure in dead stars.
- **C2-L3_Accretion_Bursts-and_Magnetic-Funnels** — looks at accretion flows and outbursts around dense objects.
