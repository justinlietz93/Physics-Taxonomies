# O1 Accretion Disc Structures — Book Suggestions

These books trace the hydrodynamics, radiation, and turbulence formalisms needed to model thin and thick discs feeding compact objects.

## Foundational Primers
- *Accretion Power in Astrophysics* — Frank, King & Raine. Standard introduction to disc equations, viscosity prescriptions, and observational diagnostics.
- *An Introduction to Active Galactic Nuclei* — B. M. Peterson. Connects disc structure equations to luminous AGN phenomena and reverberation mapping.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Theory of Black Hole Accretion Discs* — Abramowicz, Björnsson & Pringle (eds.). Advanced chapters on slim discs, radiation pressure, and magnetized flows.
- *Accretion Processes in Astrophysics* — Cannizzo & Pudritz (eds.). Focused reviews on instabilities and thermal/viscous limit cycles relevant to bursts.

## Applied References
- *High Energy Astrophysics* — M. S. Longair. Observational interpretation of disc spectra across X-ray binaries and AGN.
- *Radiative Processes in Astrophysics* — Rybicki & Lightman. Tools for converting dissipation into multi-wavelength emission signatures.
