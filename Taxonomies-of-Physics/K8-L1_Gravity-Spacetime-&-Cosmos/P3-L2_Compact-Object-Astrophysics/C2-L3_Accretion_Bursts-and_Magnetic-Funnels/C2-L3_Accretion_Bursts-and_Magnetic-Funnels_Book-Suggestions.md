# C2 Accretion Bursts and Magnetic Funnels — Book Suggestions

Accretion onto compact objects channels matter through magnetic funnels and powers bursts. These references cover disk physics, magnetospheres, and transient events.

## Accretion Theory
- *Accretion Power in Astrophysics* — Frank, King & Raine. Standard text on disk structure, boundary layers, and luminosity.
- *Foundations of High-Energy Astrophysics* — Mario Longair. Discusses accretion energetics and outburst mechanisms.

## Magnetic Funnels & Magnetospheres
- *Magnetospheric Accretion onto Young Stars* — Koenigl & Pudritz (eds.). Explores magnetic funnel flows applicable to neutron stars.
- *Plasma Physics of the Local Cosmos* — National Research Council. Covers magnetospheric processes relevant to funneling.

## Bursts & Transients
- *Compact Stellar X-ray Sources* — Lewin & van der Klis. Details X-ray bursts, quasi-periodic oscillations, and magnetic channeling.
- *Gamma-Ray Bursts* — Bing Zhang. Examines magnetized accretion engines powering relativistic bursts.
