# C2 Accretion Bursts and Magnetic Funnels — Core Equations

Accretion onto magnetized compact objects involves mass inflow, magnetic truncation, and burst energetics. These equations capture key scaling relations.

## Accretion Power
**Luminosity from accretion:**

$$L = \frac{G M \dot{M}}{R}$$

- Gravitational energy released as mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ falls onto radius $R$ around mass $M$.

**Eddington limit:**

$$L_{\text{Edd}} = \frac{4 \pi G M m_{p} c}{\sigma_{T}}$$

- Maximum isotropic luminosity balancing radiation pressure and gravity for hydrogen plasma.

## Magnetic Funnel Geometry
**Magnetospheric radius:**

$$r_{m} = \left( \frac{\mu^{4}}{2 G M \dot{M}^{2}} \right)^{1/7}$$

- Radius where magnetic pressure of dipole moment $\mu$ truncates the disk and channels flow along field lines.

**Co-rotation radius:**

$$r_{c} = \left( \frac{G M}{\Omega^{2}} \right)^{1/3}$$

- Radius where Keplerian orbital frequency matches stellar spin $\Omega$; determines propeller versus accretion regimes.

## Burst and Timing Diagnostics
**Burst fluence:**

$$E_{\text{burst}} = \int L(t) dt$$

- Total energy released during an accretion-powered burst, used to infer fuel layers and burning processes.

**Alfvén speed in funnel:**

$$v_{A} = \frac{B}{\sqrt{\mu_{0} \rho}}$$

- Speed of magnetosonic propagation along funnel field lines, affecting burst rise times and oscillations.
