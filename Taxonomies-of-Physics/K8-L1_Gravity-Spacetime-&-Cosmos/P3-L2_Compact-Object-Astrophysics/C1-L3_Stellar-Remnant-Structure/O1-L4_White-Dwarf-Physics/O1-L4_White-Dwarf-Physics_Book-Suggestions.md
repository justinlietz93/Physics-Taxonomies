# O1 White-Dwarf Physics — Book Suggestions

These readings build intuition for how degenerate matter supports compact stars, linking microphysical equations of state to observable mass–radius trends and cooling tracks.

## Foundational Primers
- *Stellar Interiors* — Hansen, Kawaler & Trimble. Offers a full treatment of hydrostatic balance, energy transport, and degeneracy, making the white dwarf chapter a clear starting point.
- *An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics* — Carroll & Ostlie. Provides broad stellar evolution context with worked examples that tie Chandrasekhar scaling to observed systems.

## Specialized Monographs
- *White Dwarfs* — D. Koester & G. Chanmugam. Focused review of structure equations, envelopes, and atmospheres that complements the order’s equation set.
- *Evolution of Stars and Stellar Populations* — Salaris & Cassisi. Details evolutionary pathways into white dwarf cooling sequences, anchoring the thermodynamic assumptions used here.

## Applied References
- *Physics of White Dwarfs* — H. Shipman. Blends observational diagnostics with interior modeling, reinforcing how to apply degeneracy relations to real data.
- *Observational Astrophysics* — R. C. Smith. Practical treatment of photometry and spectroscopy that illustrates how mass–radius relations are extracted from surveys.
