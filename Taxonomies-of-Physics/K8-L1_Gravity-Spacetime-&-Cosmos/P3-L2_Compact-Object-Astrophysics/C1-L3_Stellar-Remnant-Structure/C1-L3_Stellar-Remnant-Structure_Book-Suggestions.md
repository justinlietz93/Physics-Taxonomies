# C1 Stellar Remnant Structure — Book Suggestions

White dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes compress matter into extreme states. These references explore equation-of-state physics and structural models.

## White Dwarfs & Neutron Stars
- *Black Holes, White Dwarfs, and Neutron Stars* — Stuart L. Shapiro & Saul A. Teukolsky. Definitive text on compact object structure.
- *Neutron Stars 1: Equation of State and Structure* — P. Haensel, A.Y. Potekhin & D.G. Yakovlev. Focuses on dense matter microphysics.

## General Relativistic Structure
- *Relativistic Astrophysics of the Early Universe* — Yakov B. Zel’dovich & Igor Novikov. Covers Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff solutions and stability.
- *Compact Stellar X-ray Sources* — Walter Lewin & Michiel van der Klis. Connects structure to observable emissions.

## Observational Constraints
- *Measuring Neutron Star Radii and Masses* — Feryal Özel & Paulo Freire. Discusses observational techniques to constrain models.
- *Gravitational Waves from Compact Binaries* — Schutz & Ricci. Links structural properties to inspiral signals.
