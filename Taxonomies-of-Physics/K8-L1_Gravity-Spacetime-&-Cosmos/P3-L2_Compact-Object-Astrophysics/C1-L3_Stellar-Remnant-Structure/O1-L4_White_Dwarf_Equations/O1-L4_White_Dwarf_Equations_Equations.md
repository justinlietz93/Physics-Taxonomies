# O1 White Dwarf Equations — Core Equations

This order emphasizes the working formulas that connect microscopic degeneracy to macroscopic observables, enabling quick structure estimates for white dwarfs.

## Equation of State Forms
**Relativistic degeneracy pressure (general):**

$$P = \frac{\pi m_e^4 c^5}{3 h^3} \left[ x(2x^2-3)\sqrt{x^2+1} + 3 \sinh^{-1} x \right]$$

- Uses dimensionless Fermi momentum \(x = p_F/(m_e c)\) to interpolate between non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of electron pressure.

**Density–Fermi momentum relation:**

$$\rho = \mu_e m_u \frac{p_F^3}{3\pi^2 \hbar^3}$$

- Links matter density \(\rho\) to Fermi momentum \(p_F\) via mean molecular weight per electron \(\mu_e\) and atomic mass unit \(m_u\).

## Structural Integrals
**Mass continuity:**

$$\frac{dM_r}{dr} = 4\pi r^2 \rho(r)$$

- Connects radial density profiles to enclosed mass for integration alongside hydrostatic balance.

**Dimensionless scaling radius:**

$$a = \left[ \frac{(n+1)K}{4\pi G} \rho_c^{\frac{1-n}{n}} \right]^{1/2}$$

- Provides the characteristic length scale for polytropic solutions with index \(n\) and central density \(\rho_c\), using polytropic constant \(K\).

## Observational Relations
**Surface gravity:**

$$g = \frac{G M}{R^2}$$

- Sets the high \(\log g\) values measured in spectroscopy, tying structure solutions to line-broadening diagnostics.

**Gravitational redshift at surface:**

$$z = \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{Rc^2} \right)^{-1/2} - 1$$

- Indicates the small but measurable redshift signature expected from compact radii and masses.

## Cooling Benchmarks
**Luminosity–temperature relation (blackbody approximation):**

$$L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4$$

- Relates observed effective temperature \(T_{\text{eff}}\) to luminosity \(L\), using radii predicted by degeneracy-supported models.
