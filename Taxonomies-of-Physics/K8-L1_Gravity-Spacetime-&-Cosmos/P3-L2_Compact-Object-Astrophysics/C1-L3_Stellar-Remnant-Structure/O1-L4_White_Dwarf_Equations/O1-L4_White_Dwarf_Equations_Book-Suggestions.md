# O1 White Dwarf Equations — Book Suggestions

These titles focus on the quantitative toolkit for modeling white dwarfs, from equation-of-state derivations to observational diagnostics that validate mass–radius predictions.

## Foundational Primers
- *Compact Stars: Nuclear Physics, Particle Physics, and General Relativity* — N. K. Glendenning. Derives the structural equations with clear treatments of degeneracy physics.
- *The Theory of Stellar Structure and Evolution* — Dina Prialnik. Provides step-by-step stellar structure equations with emphasis on degenerate equations of state and cooling.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Equation of State in Astrophysics* — Chabrier & Schatzman (eds.). Collects detailed treatments of dense plasma EOS models crucial for white dwarf calculations.
- *White Dwarf Stars* — D. Koester. Lecture-style notes that bridge microscopic physics to spectroscopic observables used to infer structure.

## Applied References
- *Spectroscopic Methods in Astronomy* — D. Gray. Offers practical tools for extracting \(\log g\) and temperatures that feed mass–radius inversion.
- *Observational White Dwarf Research* — M. A. Barstow (ed.). Case studies connecting theoretical structure models with HST and ground-based datasets.
