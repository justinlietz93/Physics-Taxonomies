# O2 Neutron and Black Hole Structure — Book Suggestions

These references trace dense-matter equations of state, relativistic structure equations, and observational constraints for neutron stars and black holes.

## Foundational Primers
- *Neutron Stars 1: Equation of State and Structure* — P. Haensel, A. Y. Potekhin & D. G. Yakovlev. Comprehensive derivations of the TOV framework and EOS models.
- *Black Holes, White Dwarfs, and Neutron Stars* — S. L. Shapiro & S. A. Teukolsky. Classic treatment that unifies compact object structure with general relativity basics.

## Specialized Monographs
- *The Physics and Astrophysics of Neutron Stars* — L. Rezzolla & P. Pizzochero (eds.). Review chapters on superfluidity, rotation, and mass limits tied to the order’s equations.
- *General Relativity and Gravitation* — Wald. Provides rigorous coverage of spacetime geometry and horizons necessary to interpret Kerr and Schwarzschild limits.

## Applied References
- *Timing Neutron Stars* — Ö. Baykal et al. Focuses on pulsar timing observations that test spin and compactness relations.
- *Accretion Power in Astrophysics* — Frank, King & Raine. Links theoretical mass–radius relations to emission signatures from neutron stars and black hole candidates.
