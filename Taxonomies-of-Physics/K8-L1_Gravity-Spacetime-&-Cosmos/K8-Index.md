# K8–L1 Gravity, Spacetime, & Cosmos
**Definition:** Gravity tells matter how to move and matter tells spacetime how to curve; this kingdom tracks how cosmic structure, motion, and measurement arise from that interplay.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Native questions
- How does spacetime geometry guide clocks, rulers, and motion across different frames?
- What stories explain how mass-energy sculpts cosmic structure from stars to the whole universe?
- Which signals let us watch gravity propagate and test relativity’s predictions?

## Everyday anchors
- GPS satellites correcting their clocks for both motion and gravity to keep your maps on time.
- Images of gravitational lensing arcs around galaxy clusters acting as cosmic magnifying glasses.
- LIGO news plots turning faint spacetime ripples into audible chirps we can hear.
