# O1 Astrophysical Source Catalogs — Book Suggestions

These readings emphasize hierarchical inference, selection effects, and catalog curation for gravitational-wave sources.

## Foundational Primers
- *Bayesian Methods in Cosmology* — Hobson, Jaffe & Liddle. Introduces hierarchical Bayesian modeling applicable to GW catalogs.
- *Statistical Data Analysis* — Glen Cowan. Provides likelihood and inference tools used in population summaries.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Astrophysical Black Holes* — L. Rezzolla & P. Pani. Includes chapters on cataloging black hole binary properties from GW data.
- *Handbook of Gravitational Wave Astronomy* — B. Schutz & A. Sesana (eds.). Contains sections on population inference and catalog construction.

## Applied References
- *GWTC Catalog Papers* — LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Collaboration. Authoritative publications on released gravitational-wave source catalogs.
- *BayesWave and Bilby Documentation*. Practical guides for handling posterior samples and generating catalog-level products.
