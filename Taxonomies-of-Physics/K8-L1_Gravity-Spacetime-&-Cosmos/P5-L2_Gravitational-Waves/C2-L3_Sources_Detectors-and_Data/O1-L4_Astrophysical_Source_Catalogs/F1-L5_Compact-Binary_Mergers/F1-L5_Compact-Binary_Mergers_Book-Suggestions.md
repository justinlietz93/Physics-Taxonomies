# F1 Compact Binary Mergers — Book Suggestions

Catalog specialists curate posterior samples, metadata, and selection factors for compact binaries. These references explain observational standards, gravitational-wave context, and the statistics behind catalog releases.

## Catalog Methodology & Standards
- *Observational Astrophysics* — Pierre Léna, François Lebrun & François Mignard. Covers calibration, metadata tracking, and archive design adaptable to gravitational-wave catalogs.
- *Scientific Data Management* — Krishnan & Gopalaswamy. Provides workflows for provenance, versioning, and reproducibility in large scientific databases.

## Gravitational-Wave Catalog Context
- *Gravitational-Wave Astrophysics* — Edited by N. J. Cornish & F. Pretorius. Collects early advanced-LIGO era lessons on catalog production and event validation.
- *Multi-Messenger Astronomy* — Shafter, Reitze & Mandel. Highlights cross-survey coordination and catalog interoperability across electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observatories.

## Statistical Post-Processing
- *Practical Statistics for Astronomers* — J.V. Wall & C.R. Jenkins. Offers recipes for confidence intervals, selection corrections, and population inference from catalog tables.
- *Astroinformatics* — Borne, Murtagh & Longo. Describes machine-learning and database mining techniques for querying large event archives.
