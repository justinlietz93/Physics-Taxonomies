# G2 Compact Binary Mergers Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Applied catalog efforts need guidance on injection campaigns, selection corrections, and public data dissemination.

## Injection and Efficiency Studies
- *Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics* — Mark E. J. Newman & G. Barkema. Provides simulation strategies for generating synthetic populations and efficiency curves.
- *Practical Monte Carlo Simulation with Excel* — Jon Wittwer. Offers approachable workflows for building injection studies and visualizing completeness metrics.

## Catalog Dissemination and Reproducibility
- *Open Science by Design* — National Academies of Sciences. Lays out best practices for releasing data products, metadata, and code with gravitational-wave catalogs.
- *The Practice of Reproducible Research* — Justin Kitzes, Daniel Turek & Fatma Deniz (eds.). Covers documentation templates and workflow capture for catalog toolkits.

## Communicating Confidence Levels
- *Statistics Explained* — Perry R. Hinton. Clarifies confidence vs. credibility statements used when publishing $p_{\mathrm{astro}}$ values.
- *Visual Explanations* — Edward R. Tufte. Inspires clear graphics for completeness curves, astrophysical probabilities, and rate posteriors.
