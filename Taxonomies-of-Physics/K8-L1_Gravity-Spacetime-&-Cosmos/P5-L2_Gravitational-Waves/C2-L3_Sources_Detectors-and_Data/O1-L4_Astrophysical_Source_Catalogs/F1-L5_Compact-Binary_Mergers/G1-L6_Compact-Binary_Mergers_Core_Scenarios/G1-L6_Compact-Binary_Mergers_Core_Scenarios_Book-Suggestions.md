# G1 Compact Binary Mergers Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Catalog teams rely on references that cover parameter estimation reporting, cosmological conversions, and statistical summaries tailored to compact binaries.

## Catalog Production Guides
- *Observational Astrophysics* — Robert C. Smith. Provides best practices for constructing standardized event tables and uncertainty budgets.
- *Handbook of Gravitational Wave Astronomy* — Cosimo Bambi, Sourabh Nampalliwar & Alessandro Nagar (eds.). Includes chapters detailing LIGO/Virgo catalog pipelines and data product formats.

## Cosmology and Distance Inference
- *Cosmological Physics* — John Peacock. Offers the luminosity-distance relations and cosmological priors used to convert detector-frame masses into source-frame values.
- *Statistical Methods for Astronomical Data Analysis* — Asis Kumar Chattopadhyay & Tanuka Chattopadhyay. Discusses redshift estimation and propagation of distance uncertainties in catalogs.

## Posterior Summaries and Visualization
- *Error Analysis in Experimental Physical Science* — J. Philip O'Hara. Covers covariance reporting, credible intervals, and correlation visualization.
- *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* — Claus O. Wilke. Guides the presentation of mass-distance posteriors and network SNR panels in catalog releases.
