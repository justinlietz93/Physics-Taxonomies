# G1 Continuous and Stochastic Sources Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These references guide catalog teams working on stochastic backgrounds and persistent continuous-wave limits.

## Stochastic Background Frameworks
- *An Introduction to the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background* — Andrew J. Romero-Wolf & Joseph Romano. Lays out cross-correlation formalism and catalog reporting standards.
- *Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds* — Massimo Maggiore. Provides theory and data-analysis chapters that connect energy density to detector cross-correlation outputs.

## Continuous-Wave Catalogs
- *Continuous Gravitational Waves* — Maria Alessandra Papa & Karl Wette (eds.). Summarizes search methods, upper-limit presentations, and sky-mapping used in catalog releases.
- *Pulsar Astronomy* — Andrew Lyne & Francis Graham-Smith. Supplies timing data and target catalogs that inform continuous-wave tables.

## Statistical Reporting
- *Error and Uncertainty in Scientific Practice* — Marcel Boumans & Harald Kliemt (eds.). Discusses conveying uncertainties and correlations in large data releases.
- *Communicating Science Through Data* — Scott Murray. Offers visualization approaches for energy-density curves and upper-limit sky maps.
