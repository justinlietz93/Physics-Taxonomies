# F2 Continuous and Stochastic Sources — Book Suggestions

Continuous and stochastic catalogs mix neutron-star timing, cosmological backgrounds, and detector correlations. These resources provide the theoretical and practical grounding to manage such diverse entries.

## Stochastic Background Theory
- *Cosmology of Gravitational Waves* — Edited by Giulia Cusin & Michele Maggiore. Surveys early-Universe production channels and how they map to $\Omega_{\text{gw}}(f)$ templates.
- *Particle Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves* — Edited by Dan Hooper & Elisa Chisari. Explores beyond-standard-model sources and the spectral signatures they imprint on stochastic catalogs.

## Continuous-Wave Search Techniques
- *Pulsar Astronomy* — Andrew Lyne & Francis Graham-Smith. Provides timing solutions and rotational evolution essential for continuous-wave targeting.
- *Continuous Gravitational Wave Searches* — Reinhard Prix. A monograph on semi-coherent methods, template banks, and sensitivity depth calculations for long-duration signals.

## Detector Correlation & Data Handling
- *Statistical Inference for Noise Processes* — Monica Chiogna & Piercesare Secchi. Covers correlated-noise modeling and hypothesis testing for cross-correlation pipelines.
- *Data Analysis in High Energy Physics: A Practical Guide to Statistical Methods* — Ilya Narsky & Frank Porter. Offers practical workflows for large collaborative analyses that translate well to stochastic catalog production.
