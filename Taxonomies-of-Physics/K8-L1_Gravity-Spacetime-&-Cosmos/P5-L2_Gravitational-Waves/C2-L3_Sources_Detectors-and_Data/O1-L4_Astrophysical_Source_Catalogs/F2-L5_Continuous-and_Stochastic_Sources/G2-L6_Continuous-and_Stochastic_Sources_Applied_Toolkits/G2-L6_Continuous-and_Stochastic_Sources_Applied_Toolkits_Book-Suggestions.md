# G2 Continuous and Stochastic Sources Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

These resources focus on anisotropic background mapping, null-stream construction, and public data products for stochastic searches.

## Anisotropic Background Mapping
- *Data Analysis in Cosmology* — Vicente J. Martínez et al. (eds.). Discusses spherical-harmonic map reconstruction and inverse-variance weighting useful for gravitational-wave anisotropy toolkits.
- *Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background Maps* — Xavier Lanusse & Patricia Vielva. Provides algorithms that parallel stochastic radiometer pipelines.

## Null Streams and Detector Networks
- *Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy* — A. Richard Thompson, James M. Moran & George W. Swenson Jr. Explains closure quantities and null combinations analogous to gravitational-wave null streams.
- *Gravitational-Wave Detection by Interferometry* — Massimo Tinto & J.W. Armstrong. Covers time-delay interferometry and null-channel construction in detail.

## Public Products and Visualization
- *Principles of Data Wrangling* — Tye Rattenbury, Joe Hellerstein & Jeffrey Heer. Guides preparation of map data products and reproducible workflows.
- *Beautiful Visualization* — Julie Steele & Noah Iliinsky (eds.). Offers case studies for presenting sky maps and spectral-index grids to diverse audiences.
