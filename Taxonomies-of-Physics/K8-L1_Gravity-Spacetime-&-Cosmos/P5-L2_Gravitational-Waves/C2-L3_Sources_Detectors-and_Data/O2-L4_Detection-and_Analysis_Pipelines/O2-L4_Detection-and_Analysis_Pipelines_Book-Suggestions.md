# O2 Detection and Analysis Pipelines — Book Suggestions

These texts focus on data analysis algorithms, statistical inference, and pipeline implementations for gravitational-wave searches.

## Foundational Primers
- *Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial* — D. S. Sivia & J. Skilling. Introduces Bayesian tools essential for GW pipelines.
- *Signal Detection Theory and ROC Analysis* — J. A. Swets. Provides the statistical framework underpinning detection thresholds and false alarm metrics.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Gravitational-Wave Data Analysis* — B. Sathyaprakash & S. Dhurandhar. Comprehensive treatment of matched filtering, template banks, and vetoes.
- *Practical Statistics for Astronomers* — Wall & Jenkins. Covers background estimation, Monte Carlo methods, and significance testing for astrophysical data.

## Applied References
- *PyCBC Documentation*. Describes implementation details of the matched-filter search pipeline used in LIGO analyses.
- *GstLAL Reference Guide*. Technical manual for low-latency detection pipelines and reweighted SNR calculations.
