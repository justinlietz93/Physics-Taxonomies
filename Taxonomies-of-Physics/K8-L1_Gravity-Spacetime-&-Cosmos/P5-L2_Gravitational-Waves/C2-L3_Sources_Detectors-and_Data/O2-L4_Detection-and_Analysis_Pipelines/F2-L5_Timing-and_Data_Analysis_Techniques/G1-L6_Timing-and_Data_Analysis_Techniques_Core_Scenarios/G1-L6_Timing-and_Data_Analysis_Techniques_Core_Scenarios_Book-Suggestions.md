# G1 Timing and Data Analysis Techniques Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Timing analysts need deep knowledge of pulsar timing models, gravitational-wave correlations, and noise characterization.

## Pulsar Timing Foundations
- *Handbook of Pulsar Astronomy* — Duncan Lorimer & Michael Kramer. Covers timing models, barycentric corrections, and residual analysis from first principles.
- *Pulsar Timing and Relativistic Gravity* — Norbert Wex & Michael Kramer (eds.). Provides detailed derivations of timing delays and post-Keplerian parameters.

## Gravitational-Wave Correlations
- *Gravitational-Wave Astronomy* — Nils Andersson & Jolien Creighton. Includes chapters on Hellings-Downs correlations and stochastic background searches with PTAs.
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Astronomy* — S. Chandrasekhar. Offers foundational material on correlated noise and spectral estimation relevant to timing arrays.

## Noise Modeling and Inference
- *Bayesian Methods for Hackers* — Cameron Davidson-Pilon. Introduces approachable Bayesian tools for fitting red noise and clock terms.
- *Statistics of Random Processes* — Robert L. Stratonovich. Provides rigorous treatment of random processes underpinning residual covariance modeling.
