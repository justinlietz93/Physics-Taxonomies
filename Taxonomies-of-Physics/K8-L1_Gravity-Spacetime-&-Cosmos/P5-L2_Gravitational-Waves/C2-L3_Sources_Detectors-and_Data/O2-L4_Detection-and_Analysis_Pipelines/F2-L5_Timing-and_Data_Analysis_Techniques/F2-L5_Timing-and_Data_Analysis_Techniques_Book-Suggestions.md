# F2 Timing and Data Analysis Techniques — Book Suggestions

Timing workflows demand precision clock modeling, correlated-noise statistics, and scalable inference. These books anchor the mathematics and practical skills for pulsar and clock-based gravitational-wave searches.

## Pulsar Timing Foundations
- *Pulsar Timing and Relativistic Gravity* — Norbert Wex. Reviews timing-model construction, propagation delays, and relativistic corrections used in PTA pipelines.
- *Handbook of Pulsar Astronomy* — Lorimer & Kramer. Offers instrumentation details, timing procedures, and data standards relied upon in timing arrays.

## Noise and Correlation Modeling
- *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications* — Shumway & Stoffer. Provides autoregressive and state-space techniques for modeling red noise and clock wander.
- *Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning* — Rasmussen & Williams. Introduces kernel-based approaches increasingly used for simultaneous signal and noise inference.

## Computational Workflows
- *Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Phil Gregory. Supplies Markov-chain, nested-sampling, and evidence-evaluation strategies for timing analyses.
- *Scientific Python* — Sergio J. Rey. Demonstrates reproducible scientific computing patterns for assembling modular timing-analysis pipelines.
