# G2 Timing and Data Analysis Techniques Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Applied PTA toolkits draw on Bayesian computation, stochastic process modeling, and collaborative software practices.

## Bayesian Computation
- *Bayesian Data Analysis* — Andrew Gelman et al. Offers sampling strategies, model comparison, and marginalization techniques directly reflected in PTA pipelines.
- *Probabilistic Programming with Stan* — Michael Betancourt & Bob Carpenter. Provides practical guidance for implementing hierarchical models similar to PTA likelihoods.

## Stochastic Processes and Optimal Statistics
- *Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning* — Carl Edward Rasmussen & Christopher K. I. Williams. Covers covariance construction and marginal likelihood evaluation for correlated signals.
- *Statistical Signal Processing of Complex-Valued Data* — Peter J. Schreier & Louis L. Scharf. Supplies matrix identities and optimal quadratic statistics relevant to PTA optimal-statistic codes.

## Collaborative Infrastructure
- *Practical Reproducibility in Astronomy* — Bruce Berriman & G. Bruce (eds.). Addresses workflow capture, provenance, and data release in multinational collaborations.
- *Version Control with Git* — Jon Loeliger & Matthew McCullough. Ensures distributed teams maintain consistent analysis toolkits and review chains.
