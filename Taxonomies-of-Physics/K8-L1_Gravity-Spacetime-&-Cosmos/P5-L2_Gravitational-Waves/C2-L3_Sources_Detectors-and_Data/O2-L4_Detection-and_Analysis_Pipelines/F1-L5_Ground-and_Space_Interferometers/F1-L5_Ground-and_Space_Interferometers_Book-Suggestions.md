# F1 Ground and Space Interferometers — Book Suggestions

Coordinating ground and space interferometers requires understanding antenna geometry, calibration, and network operations. These titles offer playbooks for running multi-detector pipelines.

## Network Operations & Calibration
- *Advanced Interferometers and the Search for Gravitational Waves* — Edited by Massimo Bassan. Covers commissioning, calibration, and coherence checks across LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.
- *Gravitational-Wave Detectors* — Nary Man & Amber L. Henry. Provides practical insights on detector alignment, timing systems, and network data sharing.

## Space-Ground Coordination
- *Space-Based Gravitational-Wave Astronomy* — Edited by Neil J. Cornish. Discusses joint observing strategies and data exchange between LISA-class missions and terrestrial arrays.
- *Satellite Formation Flying* — Alfriend, Vadali, Gurfil, How & Breger. Details navigation and control concepts for arm-length maintenance in orbital interferometers.

## Localization & Multi-Messenger Follow-Up
- *Observational Astronomy* — Birney, Gonzales & Oesper. Supplies sky-mapping and scheduling methods applicable when converting localization maps into follow-up plans.
- *Multi-Messenger Observations of Gravitational Waves* — Edited by J. A. Font & P. Kumar. Summarizes case studies on how network-derived sky maps drive electromagnetic campaigns.
