# G1 Ground and Space Interferometers Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

Pipeline operators benefit from references on network geometry, low-latency alerts, and joint localization for terrestrial and space detectors.

## Network Coordination
- *Observational Astrophysics* — Robert C. Smith. Includes chapters on coordinating multi-observatory campaigns that mirror interferometer alert operations.
- *Gravitational Wave Detectors* — Ilias Cholis & Peter Shawhan (eds.). Discusses instrument layouts and network baselines relevant to timing triangulation.

## Localization and Alerting
- *Handbook of Gravitational Wave Astronomy* — Cosimo Bambi et al. (eds.). Provides details on BAYESTAR, coherent SNR calculations, and skymap generation for alerts.
- *Multi-Messenger Astronomy in Practice* — Brigitte Falkenburg & Margaret Morrison. Offers procedures for distributing alerts and coordinating follow-up teams.

## Space-Ground Synergy
- *The LISA Mission* — Karsten Danzmann & Neil Cornish (eds.). Explains how future space interferometers coordinate with ground networks for joint detections.
- *High-Energy Astrophysics* — Malcolm S. Longair. Supplies contextual background on electromagnetic facilities that consume gravitational-wave skymaps.
