# F2 Merger Simulation Workflows — Book Suggestions

Simulation workflows need resources that bridge analytical relativity, high-performance computing, and waveform validation. These titles help teams set up, run, and interpret compact-binary merger models.

## Numerical Relativity Foundations
- *Numerical Relativity* — Thomas W. Baumgarte & Stuart L. Shapiro. The core reference for solving Einstein's equations on the grid, with gauge choices and extraction recipes used in merger codes.
- *Relativistic Hydrodynamics* — Luciano Rezzolla & Olindo Zanotti. Details conservative formulations and flux schemes that underpin neutron-star merger pipelines.

## Waveform Modeling References
- *Gravitational Waves: Volume 1* — Michele Maggiore. Provides the post-Newtonian and phenomenological waveform theory needed to stitch inspiral, merger, and ringdown segments.
- *Effective One Body Approach to General Relativistic Two Body Dynamics* — Thibault Damour & Alessandro Nagar. Summarizes the EOB framework and calibration strategy against numerical relativity runs.

## Software and Pipeline Guides
- *Handbook of Gravitational Wave Astronomy* — Edited by C. Bambi et al. Collects chapters on waveform catalogs, surrogate modeling, and infrastructure used by LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA teams.
- *Numerical Methods in Astrophysics: An Introduction* — Bodenheimer, Laughlin, Różyczka & Yorke. Offers practical advice on timestep control, grid management, and convergence tests shared across merger workflows.
