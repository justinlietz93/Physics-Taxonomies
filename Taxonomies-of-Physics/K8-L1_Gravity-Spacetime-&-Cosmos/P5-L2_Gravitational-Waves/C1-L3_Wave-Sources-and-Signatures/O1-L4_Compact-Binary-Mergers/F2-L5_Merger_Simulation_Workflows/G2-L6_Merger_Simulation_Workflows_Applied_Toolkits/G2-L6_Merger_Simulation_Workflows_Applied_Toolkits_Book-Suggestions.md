# G2 Merger Simulation Workflows Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Applied toolkits teams need resources on reduced-order modeling, surrogate construction, and parameter estimation pipelines to transform heavy simulations into sharable assets.

## Surrogate and Reduced-Order Modeling
- *Reduced Order Methods for Modeling and Computational Reduction* — Alfio Quarteroni, Andrea Manzoni & Federico Negri. Covers basis compression, empirical interpolation, and error control central to waveform surrogates.
- *Model Order Reduction: Theory, Research Aspects and Applications* — Wil Schilders, H.A. van der Vorst & Joost Rommes (eds.). Provides cross-disciplinary strategies for building fast surrogates and quantifying mismatch.

## Calibration and Parameter Fitting
- *The Effective One Body Approach to General Relativistic Two Body Dynamics* — Thibault Damour & Alessandro Nagar. Details calibration of analytical models against numerical relativity, aligning with toolkit tuning tasks.
- *Data Analysis in Gravitational-Wave Astronomy* — Xavier Siemens & Jolien Creighton. Explains parameter estimation workflows that consume surrogate waveforms and set accuracy requirements.

## Software Engineering for Toolkits
- *High Performance Python* — Micha Gorelick & Ian Ozsvald. Offers profiling and vectorization techniques for speeding up surrogate evaluation scripts shared with observers.
- *Collaborative Software for Science* — Kyle E. Niemeyer & Lorena A. Barba (eds.). Discusses reproducibility, packaging, and documentation practices that keep applied toolkits usable across collaborations.
