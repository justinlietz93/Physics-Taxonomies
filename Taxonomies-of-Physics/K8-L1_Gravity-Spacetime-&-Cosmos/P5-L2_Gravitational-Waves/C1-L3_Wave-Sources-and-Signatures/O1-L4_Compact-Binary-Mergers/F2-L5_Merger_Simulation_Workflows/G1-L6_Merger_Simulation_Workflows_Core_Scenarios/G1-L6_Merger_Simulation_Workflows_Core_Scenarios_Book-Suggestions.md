# G1 Merger Simulation Workflows Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These references keep core workflow teams grounded in stable numerical relativity formalisms, mesh refinement strategy, and waveform extraction essentials.

## Numerical Relativity Foundations
- *Numerical Relativity* — Thomas W. Baumgarte & Stuart L. Shapiro. The standard reference on BSSN formulations, gauge choices, and constraint enforcement that underpins every core workflow.
- *Relativistic Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics* — Luciano Rezzolla & Olindo Zanotti. Provides evolution equations and test problems for coupling fluid components to spacetime solvers.

## Discretization and Stability
- *Finite Difference Methods for Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations* — Randall J. LeVeque. Offers CFL analyses and stencil design practices directly applicable to merger grids.
- *Spectral Methods in General Relativity* — Mark Hannam & Jan Steinhoff (eds.). Collects best practices for spectral codes such as SpEC used in baseline waveform catalogs.

## Wave Extraction and Diagnostics
- *Gravitational Waves from Relativistic Compact Binaries* — Luc Blanchet. Supplies post-Newtonian comparisons that validate numerical outputs and guide news-function diagnostics.
- *General Relativity and Gravitation: A Centennial Perspective* — Ashtekar, Berger, Isenberg & MacCallum (eds.). Includes chapters on waveform extraction and gauge-invariant measures for cross-code benchmarking.
