# F1 Inspiral Chirp Stories â€” Core Equations

Inspiral chirps track how compact binaries whirl faster and louder as they radiate orbital energy. These relations translate masses and distances into the rising tone featured in discovery plots.

## Keplerian Orbital Frequency
**Quasi-circular binaries still follow near-Keplerian motion at large separations.**

$$\Omega = \sqrt{\frac{G (m_1 + m_2)}{a^3}}$$

- Orbital angular frequency $\Omega$ links component masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ with separation $a$, anchoring the chirp's starting pitch before relativistic corrections stack in.

## Chirp Mass Definition
**The combination that fixes how fast the tone sweeps upward.**

$$\mathcal{M} = \frac{(m_1 m_2)^{3/5}}{(m_1 + m_2)^{1/5}}$$

- The chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$ distills the binary's inertia into one term, letting storytellers explain why equal-mass systems brighten longer than extreme mass-ratio pairs.

## Frequency Sweep from Radiation Reaction
**Leading-order post-Newtonian frequency evolution.**

$$\frac{df}{dt} = \frac{96}{5}\pi^{8/3}\left(\frac{G\mathcal{M}}{c^3}\right)^{5/3} f^{11/3}$$

- The rate of frequency increase $df/dt$ shows how gravitational-wave emission drives the chirp; higher frequencies $f$ accelerate the sweep because more power leaves the orbit.

## Inspiral Strain Amplitude
**Observable loudness for a face-on binary.**

$$h(f) = \frac{4 (G\mathcal{M})^{5/3}}{c^4 D_L} (\pi f)^{2/3}$$

- Strain $h$ scales with chirp mass and observed frequency while being diluted by luminosity distance $D_L$, connecting catalog masses to the outreach audio track.
