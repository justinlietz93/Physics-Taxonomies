# G1 Black Hole vs Neutron Star Pairs — Book Suggestions

Curated readings show how asymmetric binaries braid tidal science with dramatic storytelling. These picks balance waveform modeling, dense-matter insights, and narrative hooks for mixed compact pairs.

## Mixed Binary Physics Primers
- *Relativistic Hydrodynamics* — Luciano Rezzolla & Olindo Zanotti. Explains fluid and magnetohydrodynamic formalisms that decide whether neutron-star matter is stripped into spirals or vanishes behind the horizon.
- *Physics of Neutron Star Interiors* — D. Blaschke, N.K. Glendenning & A. Sedrakian. Surveys dense-matter equations of state and tidal deformabilities that outreach teams cite when contrasting black hole versus neutron star companions.

## Waveform Interpretation Guides
- *Modeling Binary Neutron Star Mergers* — Tim Dietrich & Sebastiano Bernuzzi. Covers effective-one-body and tidal corrections with plots that highlight when disruption cuts the signal short.
- *Gravitational Waves from Merging Compact Binaries* — Philippe Grandclément & Jérôme Novak. Offers waveform catalogs comparing black hole–black hole, neutron star–neutron star, and mixed systems for quick visual contrasts.

## Public-Facing Narratives
- *Ripples in Spacetime* — Govert Schilling. Provides storytelling frameworks for the first black hole–neutron star detections and how scientists explained their tidal clues to the public.
- *Einstein's Shadow* — Seth Fletcher. Gives behind-the-scenes insights from horizon-scale imaging that help frame why tidal disruption is the counterpart spectacle for neutron star partners.
