# G2 Inspiral Chirp Stories Extension Portfolios â€” Core Equations

Extension portfolios remix chirp narratives for different audiences by folding in cosmology, orientation, and detector reach. These equations supply the knobs that educators tweak when adapting the base story.

## Redshifted Chirp Mass
**Shows how distant binaries appear heavier to the listener.**

$$\mathcal{M}_z = (1+z)\, \mathcal{M}$$

- The observed chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_z$ scales with redshift $z$; presenters use it to explain why faraway sources seem to chirp more slowly even if their intrinsic masses match local events.

## Inclination Projection Factor
**Controls how loud the plus polarization sounds to different viewers.**

$$F_{+}(\iota) = \frac{1 + \cos^2 \iota}{2}$$

- The projection factor $F_{+}$ translates the binary's tilt angle $\iota$ into amplitude changes, guiding animations that swap between face-on and edge-on perspectives.

## Detector Reach via Characteristic Strain
**Connects waveform strength to an intuitive distance horizon.**

$$h_{\mathrm{c}}(f) = 2f \left| \tilde{h}(f) \right|$$

- The characteristic strain $h_{\mathrm{c}}$ multiplies frequency $f$ by the Fourier-domain waveform $\tilde{h}(f)$; overlaying it on noise curves visualizes which instruments can hear each portfolio variant.

## Matched-Filter Signal-to-Noise Ratio
**Sets the threshold for turning a story beat into a detection.**

$$\rho^2 = 4 \int_{f_{\mathrm{low}}}^{f_{\mathrm{high}}} \frac{\left| \tilde{h}(f) \right|^2}{S_n(f)} \, df$$

- The squared SNR $\rho^2$ integrates the waveform against the detector noise spectrum $S_n(f)$, letting communicators state how long an instrument must listen to claim success.
