# G1 Burst and Continuous Emitters Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These works cover the astrophysical engines and observational strategies behind transient bursts and persistent continuous-wave sources.

## Burst Phenomena Foundations
- *Supernovae and Nucleosynthesis* — David Arnett. Describes the core-collapse dynamics that anchor burst strain estimates and energetics.
- *Cosmic Strings and Other Topological Defects* — A. Vilenkin & E.P.S. Shellard. Explores exotic burst scenarios and their gravitational-wave signatures.

## Continuous-Wave Source Physics
- *Neutron Stars 1: Equation of State and Structure* — P. Haensel, A.Y. Potekhin & D.G. Yakovlev. Details ellipticity limits, crustal physics, and spin evolution for persistent emitters.
- *Pulsar Astronomy* — Andrew Lyne & Francis Graham-Smith. Provides observational context for timing noise, spin-down, and target catalogs.

## Backgrounds and Population Overlaps
- *Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds* — M. Maggiore & A. Nicolis (eds.). Offers models where many burst or continuous signals overlap into a background.
- *Multi-Messenger Astronomy* — J. van Paradijs, H. Hjellming & E.P.J. van den Heuvel (eds.). Highlights how electromagnetic counterparts validate rate assumptions across burst and continuous families.
