# G1 Burst and Continuous Emitters Core Scenarios â€” Core Equations

Core scenarios compare short-lived transients with long-lived continuous signals. These relations distill energy output, strain expectations, and spin physics into accessible metrics.

## Burst Strain from Energy Release
**Relates a burst's energy budget to its observed amplitude.**

$$h_{\mathrm{rss}} \approx \frac{1}{D} \sqrt{\frac{2G}{\pi^2 c^3} \frac{E_{\mathrm{GW}}}{f_{\mathrm{peak}}^2}}$$

- The root-sum-square strain $h_{\mathrm{rss}}$ scales with emitted gravitational-wave energy $E_{\mathrm{GW}}$, characteristic frequency $f_{\mathrm{peak}}$, and distance $D$, guiding expectations for core burst scenarios like core-collapse supernovae.

## Continuous-Wave Amplitude from Ellipticity
**Predicts steady signals from deformed neutron stars.**

$$h_0 = \frac{4 \pi^2 G I \epsilon f^2}{c^4 d}$$

- The amplitude $h_0$ depends on stellar moment of inertia $I$, ellipticity $\epsilon$, rotational frequency $f$, and distance $d$, setting target strains for known pulsars.

## Spin-Down Limit
**Provides an upper bound using observed rotational energy loss.**

$$h_{\mathrm{sd}} = \frac{1}{d} \sqrt{\frac{5 G I |\dot{f}|}{2 c^3 f}}$$

- The spin-down limit converts a pulsar's frequency derivative $\dot{f}$ into a maximum possible gravitational-wave amplitude, helping explain why many targets remain undetected.

## Stochastic Background Energy Density
**Frames overlapping bursts and continuous sources as a background.**

$$\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}(f) = \frac{1}{\rho_{\mathrm{c}}} \frac{d \rho_{\mathrm{GW}}}{d \ln f}$$

- The dimensionless energy density $\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}$ compares gravitational-wave energy to the critical density $\rho_{\mathrm{c}}$, connecting core scenario rates to stochastic backgrounds.
