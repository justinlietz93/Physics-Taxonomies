# G2 Burst and Continuous Emitters Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

These books help toolkit developers turn burst and continuous-wave theories into robust search software and interpretive products.

## Burst Search Algorithms
- *Time-Frequency Analysis of Gravitational Wave Data* — Graham Woan & Jonathan Gair (eds.). Details wavelet transforms, clustering algorithms, and coherent statistics used in burst toolkits.
- *Detection of Gravitational Waves* — David G. Blair (ed.). Includes instrumentation and data-analysis chapters highlighting excess-power pipelines and veto strategies.

## Continuous-Wave Detection Methods
- *Continuous Gravitational Wave Searches* — Karl Wette & Maria Alessandra Papa (eds.). Provides deep dives into $\mathcal{F}$-statistic implementations, stack-slide methods, and upper-limit reporting.
- *Pulsar Timing and Relativistic Gravity* — D.R. Lorimer & M. Kramer (eds.). Offers practical considerations for combining electromagnetic timing with gravitational-wave searches.

## Software Reliability and Pipelines
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* — Martin Kleppmann. Teaches data-flow orchestration, fault tolerance, and reproducibility that underpin production search toolkits.
- *Practical Reproducibility in Astronomy* — Bruce Berriman & G. Bruce (eds.). Covers workflow management and provenance tracking essential for maintaining burst and continuous analysis suites.
