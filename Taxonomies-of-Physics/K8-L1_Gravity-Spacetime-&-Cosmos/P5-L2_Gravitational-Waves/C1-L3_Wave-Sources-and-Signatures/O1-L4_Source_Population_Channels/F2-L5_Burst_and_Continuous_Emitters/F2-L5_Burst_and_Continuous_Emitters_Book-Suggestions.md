# F2 Burst and Continuous Emitters — Book Suggestions

Burst and continuous channels span core-collapse explosions, magnetar flares, and long-lived neutron-star mountains. These books supply the astrophysics, signal models, and search strategies needed to curate both extremes in catalogs.

## Burst Source Physics
- *Supernovae and Nucleosynthesis* — David Arnett. Explains the violent fluid dynamics and asymmetries that seed gravitational-wave bursts from collapsing stars.
- *Gamma-Ray Bursts* — Bing Zhang. Offers insight into relativistic jet formation and the rapid energy releases that generate short-lived gravitational spikes.

## Continuous-Wave Foundations
- *Neutron Stars and Pulsars* — Werner Becker. Surveys spin evolution, magnetic braking, and mountains relevant to persistent gravitational emitters.
- *Gravitational Waves from Neutron Stars* — Edited by Stefano Marassi & Cristiano Palomba. Focuses on continuous-wave amplitudes, spin-down limits, and target lists for long-term searches.

## Search and Catalog Techniques
- *Handbook of Pulsar Astronomy* — Lorimer & Kramer. Provides timing models and noise treatments that feed directly into continuous-wave pipelines.
- *Astrophysics of Gravitational Wave Sources* — Edited by M. Coleman Miller & Bárbara J. S. Schecter. Collects strategy chapters on burst triggers, electromagnetic cross-matching, and catalog archiving.
