# F2 Burst and Continuous Emitters â€” Core Equations

Burst and continuous sources require different measures of gravitational-wave strength. These relations translate source physics into catalog metrics for short-lived flares and steady beacons.

## Root-Sum-Square Strain
**Standard measure for transient bursts.**

$$h_{\text{rss}} = \sqrt{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \left(|h_+(t)|^2 + |h_\times(t)|^2\right) dt}$$

- The root-sum-square strain $h_{\text{rss}}$ summarizes burst loudness independent of phase, letting catalogs compare flares from different progenitors.

## Continuous-Wave Spin-Down Limit
**Upper bound on neutron-star strain assuming all loss is gravitational.**

$$h_0^{\text{sd}} = \frac{1}{D} \sqrt{\frac{5 G I |\dot{f}|}{2 c^3 f}}$$

- The spin-down limit $h_0^{\text{sd}}$ uses stellar moment of inertia $I$, observed spin frequency $f$, and its derivative $\dot{f}$ to set detection targets at distance $D$.

## Characteristic Strain for Long Signals
**Connecting steady emission to detector sensitivity.**

$$h_c(f) = h_0 \sqrt{N_{\text{cycles}}}$$

- Characteristic strain $h_c$ boosts amplitude $h_0$ by the square root of observed cycles $N_{\text{cycles}}$, showing how long-lived sources build significance in searches.
