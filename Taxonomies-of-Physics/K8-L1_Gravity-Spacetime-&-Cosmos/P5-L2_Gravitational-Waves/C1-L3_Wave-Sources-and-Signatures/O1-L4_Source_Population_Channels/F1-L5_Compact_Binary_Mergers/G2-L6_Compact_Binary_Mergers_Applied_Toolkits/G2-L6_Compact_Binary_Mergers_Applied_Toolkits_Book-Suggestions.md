# G2 Compact Binary Mergers Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Applied population teams leverage statistical reweighting, selection-function modeling, and software design. These books reinforce those skills.

## Hierarchical Inference Manuals
- *Bayesian Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — G. Gregory & T. Loredo (eds.). Focuses on hierarchical modeling techniques mirroring gravitational-wave population inference codes.
- *Bayesian Data Analysis* — Andrew Gelman et al. Provides practical strategies for posterior reweighting, model comparison, and prior sensitivity studies.

## Selection Effects and Survey Design
- *Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy V* — Eric D. Feigelson & G. Jogesh Babu (eds.). Includes chapters on survey completeness and detection efficiency that align with selection-function calculations.
- *Survey Sampling: Theory and Methods* — Arijit Chaudhuri & Horst Stenger. Supplies weighting and normalization techniques useful when translating pipeline efficiencies into astrophysical priors.

## Reusable Codebases
- *Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers* — Cameron Davidson-Pilon. Offers open-source workflows for building reusable inference toolkits and communicating uncertainty.
- *Building Scientific Python Tools* — Gabriele Lanaro. Discusses packaging, testing, and documentation practices that keep applied merger-population libraries reliable.
