# F1 Compact Binary Mergers — Book Suggestions

Compact-binary population channels need sources that connect stellar evolution, rate modeling, and statistical inference. These selections help map how different birth environments fill gravitational-wave catalogs.

## Merger Population Overviews
- *Evolutionary Processes in Binary and Multiple Stars* — Peter P. Eggleton. Explains mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, and natal kicks that seed distinct merger channels.
- *Compact Stellar X-ray Sources* — Edited by Walter H.G. Lewin & Michiel van der Klis. Profiles observational counterparts of tight binaries and the evolutionary routes that lead to coalescence.

## Rate Modeling References
- *Gravitational Waves: Volume 2* — Michele Maggiore. Covers cosmic star-formation histories, delay-time distributions, and merger rate predictions with worked examples.
- *The Handbook of Gravitational Wave Astronomy* — Edited by C. Bambi et al. Includes dedicated chapters on population synthesis and selection biases for compact binaries.

## Catalog Interpretation & Statistics
- *Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Phil Gregory. Provides hierarchical modeling recipes for inferring intrinsic merger populations from detected samples.
- *Statistical Methods for Astronomy with R Applications* — Feigelson & Babu. Offers practical tools for censored datasets and selection effects encountered in gravitational-wave catalogs.
