# G2 Data Analysis Toolkits Applied Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Applied teams benefit from resources on ranking-statistic design, background estimation, and Bayesian inference software.

## Detection Statistics and Backgrounds
- *Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics* — Frederick James. Presents likelihood-ratio tests, significance calculations, and background estimation techniques used in gravitational-wave search reports.
- *Poisson Processes* — Ashkan Nikeghbali. Offers mathematical grounding for FAR and FAP calculations underlying alert systems.

## Bayesian Inference Software
- *Bayesian Logical Data Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Phil Gregory. Provides recipes for evidence computation and posterior sampling mirrored in parameter-estimation toolkits.
- *Probabilistic Programming with Stan* — Michael Betancourt & Bob Carpenter. Demonstrates how to build hierarchical models and calibrate samplers for gravitational-wave posteriors.

## Collaboration Reporting and Visualization
- *Storytelling with Data* — Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. Guides the transformation of ranking statistics and posteriors into publication-ready plots.
- *Effective Data Storytelling* — Brent Dykes. Offers frameworks for communicating detection confidence and parameter intervals to diverse audiences.
