# G1 Data Analysis Toolkits Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These texts reinforce the fundamentals behind PSD estimation, matched filtering, and statistical signal processing for gravitational-wave data.

## Signal Processing Foundations
- *Statistical Signal Processing* — Louis L. Scharf. Covers spectral estimation, filtering theory, and detection statistics central to core gravitational-wave toolkits.
- *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications* — Robert H. Shumway & David S. Stoffer. Provides practical guidance on windowing, stationarity tests, and noise modeling.

## Gravitational-Wave Analysis Primers
- *An Introduction to Data Analysis in Gravitational-Wave Astronomy* — Daniel Kennefick & Patrick Brady. Walks through whitening, matched filters, and chi-squared vetoes using case studies from LIGO/Virgo.
- *Data Analysis Techniques for Physical Scientists* — Louis Lyons. Offers clear explanations of likelihoods, hypothesis testing, and error propagation.

## Software Implementation Aids
- *Scientific Python: Building Machine Learning and Data Science Applications* — Andrew Carter. Demonstrates NumPy/SciPy workflows for PSD estimation and filter construction.
- *Practical Numerical and Scientific Computing with MATLAB® and Python* — Akinwale Akinbiyi. Provides step-by-step implementations of FFT pipelines analogous to gravitational-wave toolkits.
