# S2-L7_Data-Analysis-Toolkits_Applied_Field_Kit — Species Index
**Definition:** Packages Data Analysis Toolkits into a multi-shift duty roster that a small team can run without special gear.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Frame the steps as assembling the multi-shift duty roster, mapping each move to the data analysis toolkits checkpoints.
- Close by suggesting a quick debrief so the crew can tune the data analysis toolkits playbook.
