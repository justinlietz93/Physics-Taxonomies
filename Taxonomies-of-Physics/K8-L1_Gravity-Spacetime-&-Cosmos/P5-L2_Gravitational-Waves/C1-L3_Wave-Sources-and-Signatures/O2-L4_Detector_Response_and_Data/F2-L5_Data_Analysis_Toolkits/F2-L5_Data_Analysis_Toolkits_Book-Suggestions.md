# F2 Data Analysis Toolkits — Book Suggestions

Toolkit builders blend signal processing, statistics, and software engineering. These books supply the mathematical and practical background for pipelines that sift detector data.

## Matched Filtering & Detection
- *Gravitational-Wave Data Analysis* — Edited by Bernard F. Schutz. A classic treatment of matched filtering, time-frequency methods, and detector characterization.
- *The Detection of Gravitational Waves* — David G. Blair. Provides hardware context plus in-depth chapters on data conditioning and veto strategies.

## Bayesian & Statistical Foundations
- *Bayesian Methods in Cosmology* — Hobson, Jaffe, Liddle, Mukherjee & Parkinson. Offers hierarchical modeling and evidence calculations adaptable to gravitational-wave inference.
- *Statistical Data Analysis* — Glen Cowan. Covers likelihood construction, hypothesis testing, and information criteria used in event ranking.

## Software and Pipeline Practice
- *Python for Data Analysis* — Wes McKinney. Demonstrates data wrangling patterns mirrored in gravitational-wave workflow notebooks.
- *High Performance Python* — Micha Gorelick & Ian Ozsvald. Guides optimization, vectorization, and parallelism for accelerating template banks and samplers.
