# O2 Detector Response and Data — Book Suggestions

These resources focus on interferometer design, calibration, and data analysis techniques that turn detector strain measurements into astrophysical results.

## Foundational Primers
- *Gravitational-Wave Detection* — David Blair (ed.). Explains interferometer architecture, noise budgets, and antenna patterns.
- *An Introduction to Data Analysis in Gravitational-Wave Astronomy* — Daniel Foreman-Mackey (notes). Provides Bayesian and matched-filter basics tailored to interferometer data.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Optical Cavities and Interferometers* — K. Arai & Y. Chen. Details optical response models and calibration strategies for GW detectors.
- *Advanced Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Detectors* — T. T. Nakamura (ed.). Covers upgrades, squeezed light, and network sensitivity forecasts.

## Applied References
- *LIGO Calibration Papers*. Document procedures for estimating \(S_n(f)\) and uncertainty budgets in strain data.
- *GWOSC User Guide*. Official guide for accessing public data products, antenna response metadata, and analysis pipelines.
