# F1 Ground and Space Detector Tech — Book Suggestions

Instrument teams balance optical design, seismic isolation, and space-environment challenges. These books cover the engineering principles behind both terrestrial and orbital interferometers.

## Ground-Based Interferometer Design
- *Fundamentals of Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors* — Peter R. Saulson. Explains Michelson response, cavity finesse, and noise budgets for kilometer-scale facilities.
- *Optical Coatings and Thermal Noise in Precision Measurement* — Edited by Gregory Harry & Timothy Bodiya. Details coating materials, thermal models, and mechanical loss measurements central to advanced LIGO and Virgo upgrades.

## Space Mission Architectures
- *LISA: Probing the Universe with Gravitational Waves* — Edited by Neil J. Cornish & Scott A. Hughes. Summarizes constellation design, drag-free control, and arm-length metrology for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.
- *Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detectors* — Edited by Michelle C. Guidry & Soumya D. Mohanty. Covers technology demonstrators, formation flying, and laser stabilization strategies for space missions.

## Systems Engineering & Noise Control
- *The Science of Precision Measurement* — David J. Wineland & David J. Howe. Provides metrology fundamentals for vibration isolation, frequency standards, and control loops.
- *Engineering Noise Control* — David A. Bies & Colin H. Hansen. Offers practical approaches to damping, isolation, and acoustic shielding applicable to both ground suspensions and spacecraft buses.
