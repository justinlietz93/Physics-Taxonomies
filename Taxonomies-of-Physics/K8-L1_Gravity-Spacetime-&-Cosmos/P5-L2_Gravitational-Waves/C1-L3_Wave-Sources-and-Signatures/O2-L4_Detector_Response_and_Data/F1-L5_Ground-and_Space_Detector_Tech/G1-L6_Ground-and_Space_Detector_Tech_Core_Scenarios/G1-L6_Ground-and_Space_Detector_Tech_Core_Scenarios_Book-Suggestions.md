# G1 Ground and Space Detector Tech Core Scenarios — Book Suggestions

These books reinforce the fundamentals of interferometric detector design across ground-based and space-based platforms.

## Interferometer Design Foundations
- *Optical Measurements for Scientists and Engineers* — Arthur McClelland & Max Planck. Covers interferometric phase sensing, noise couplings, and alignment basics central to core detector setups.
- *Quantum Measurement in Optical Interferometers* — Carlton Caves & collaborators (eds.). Explores shot noise, radiation pressure, and squeezing strategies that define sensitivity budgets.

## Suspension and Seismic Isolation
- *The Science of Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors* — Gijs Nelemans, J. Harms & T. Accadia (eds.). Details suspension design, isolation stacks, and thermal noise mitigation for ground facilities.
- *Space-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors* — M. Hewitson & K. Danzmann (eds.). Provides overviews of drag-free control and laser metrology for missions like LISA.

## Noise Hunting and Commissioning
- *Commissioning of Gravitational Wave Detectors* — R. Schilling & K. Arai (eds.). Offers practical guides for diagnosing noise sources and validating core performance metrics.
- *Seismic Noise and Its Applications* — J. Havskov & L. Ottemöller. Supplies models for environmental coupling that engineers must suppress when designing detector infrastructure.
