# C1 Wave Sources and Signatures — Book Suggestions

Gravitational waves originate from accelerating masses. These references survey source modeling and waveform signatures across binary systems, supernovae, and stochastic backgrounds.

## Source Modeling
- *Gravitational Waves* — Michele Maggiore (Vol. 1). Covers quadrupole radiation, binary inspirals, and waveform approximations.
- *Binary Neutron Star Systems* — Hans Reisswig & Christian D. Ott. Discusses numerical relativity modeling of mergers and collapses.

## Wave Signatures
- *Gravitational-Wave Physics and Astronomy* — Jolien Creighton & Warren Anderson. Provides matched-filtering techniques and waveform catalogs.
- *Gravitational Waves from Phase Transitions* — Chiara Caprini et al. Reviews stochastic backgrounds from early-universe processes.

## Observational Context
- *Advanced LIGO: The Instrument* — Harry & LIGO Scientific Collaboration. Instrument overview connecting sources to detector responses.
- *Listening to the Universe* — Janna Levin. Narrative on discoveries and signature interpretation.
