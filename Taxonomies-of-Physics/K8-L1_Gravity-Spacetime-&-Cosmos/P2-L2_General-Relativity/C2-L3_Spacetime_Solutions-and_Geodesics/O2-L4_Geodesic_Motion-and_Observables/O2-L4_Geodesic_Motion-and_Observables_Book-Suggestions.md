# O2 Geodesic Motion and Observables — Book Suggestions

These books tie geodesic calculations to measurable phenomena like lensing, precession, and time delay.

## Classic Treatments
- *Gravitation* — Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne & John A. Wheeler. Extensive coverage of observable effects from geodesics including deflection and time delay.
- *Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics* — Clifford M. Will. Connects geodesic predictions with precision tests and parameterized post-Newtonian results.

## Astrophysical Applications
- *Black Holes, White Dwarfs, and Neutron Stars* — Stuart L. Shapiro & Saul A. Teukolsky. Applies geodesic analysis to orbits, ISCOs, and observable signatures near compact objects.
- *Gravitational Lensing* — Peter Schneider, Jürgen Ehlers & Emilio E. Falco. Detailed derivations of Einstein radius, deflection angles, and time delays.

## Observational Guides
- *Relativistic Astrophysics* — Marek A. Abramowicz & P.C. Fragile. Focuses on accretion disks, perihelion precession, and observational diagnostics.
- *Testing General Relativity with Present and Future Astrophysical Observations* — Clifford M. Will & Nicolas Yunes. Survey of modern experiments targeting geodesic observables.
