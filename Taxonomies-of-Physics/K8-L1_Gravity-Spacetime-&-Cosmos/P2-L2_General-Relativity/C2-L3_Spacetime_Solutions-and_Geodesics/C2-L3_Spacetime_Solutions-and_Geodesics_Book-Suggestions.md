# C2 Spacetime Solutions and Geodesics — Book Suggestions

Exact solutions to Einstein’s equations reveal black holes, cosmologies, and gravitational waves. These references catalog metrics and analyze their geodesics.

## Solution Catalogs
- *Exact Solutions of Einstein’s Field Equations* — Hans Stephani et al. Comprehensive reference on known metrics and properties.
- *The Classical Theory of Fields* — Landau & Lifshitz. Presents Schwarzschild, Kerr, and cosmological solutions with geodesic analyses.

## Black Hole Geodesics
- *Black Holes: The Membrane Paradigm* — Thorne, Price & Macdonald. Offers intuitive tools for studying Kerr geodesics and horizon physics.
- *Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein’s General Relativity* — James B. Hartle. Provides detailed examples of geodesic motion in Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes.

## Numerical & Observational Links
