# C1 Curved Spacetime Geodesy — Book Suggestions

Geodesy in general relativity tracks how matter and light traverse curved spacetime. These resources explain metrics, geodesic equations, and observational signatures.

## Foundational Texts
- *Gravitation* — Misner, Thorne & Wheeler. Comprehensive guide to curved spacetime and geodesic motion.
- *A First Course in General Relativity* — Bernard Schutz. Accessible introduction to metrics and geodesic computation.

## Mathematical Tools
- *General Relativity* — Robert Wald. Provides rigorous tensor calculus and geodesic derivations.
- *Spacetime and Geometry* — Sean Carroll. Offers coordinate-free approaches and worked geodesic examples.

## Observational Links
- *Relativity in Modern Astrophysics* — B. F. Schutz & A. M. Matas. Connects geodesics to gravitational lensing and orbital dynamics.
- *Gravitational Lensing* — Peter Schneider et al. Demonstrates geodesic deflection and observational consequences.
