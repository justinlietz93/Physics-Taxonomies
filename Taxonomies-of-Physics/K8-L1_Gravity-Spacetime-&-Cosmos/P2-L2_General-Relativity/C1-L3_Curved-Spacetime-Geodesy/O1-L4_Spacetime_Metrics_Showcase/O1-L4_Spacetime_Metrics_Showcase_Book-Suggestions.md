# O1 Spacetime Metrics Showcase — Book Suggestions

These books catalog important metrics and teach how to read their geometric content.

## Metric Compendia
- *Exact Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations* — Hans Stephani et al. Encyclopedic reference of known metrics and their properties.
- *A Short Course in General Relativity* — James A. Foster & J.D. Nightingale. Provides worked examples for Schwarzschild, Kerr, and cosmological metrics.

## Pedagogical Introductions
- *Spacetime and Geometry* — Sean M. Carroll. Intuitive introduction to metrics, curvature, and coordinate choices.
- *Introducing Einstein's Relativity* — Ray d'Inverno. Step-by-step derivations of common line elements and their geodesics.

## Applied Contexts
- *Gravitation* — Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne & John A. Wheeler. Deep insights into metric interpretation, embedding diagrams, and physical meaning.
- *General Relativity and Cosmology* — Steven Weinberg. Connects cosmological metrics to observations and perturbations.
