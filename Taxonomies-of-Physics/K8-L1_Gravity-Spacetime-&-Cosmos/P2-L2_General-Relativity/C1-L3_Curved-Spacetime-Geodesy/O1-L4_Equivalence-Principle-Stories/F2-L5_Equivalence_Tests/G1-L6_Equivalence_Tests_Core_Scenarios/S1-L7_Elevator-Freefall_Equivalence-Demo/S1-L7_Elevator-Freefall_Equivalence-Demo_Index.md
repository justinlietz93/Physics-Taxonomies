# S1-L7_Elevator-Freefall_Equivalence-Demo — Species Index
**Definition:** Riders feel weightless in a drop tower cab, mirroring astronauts in orbit so the equivalence principle becomes tactile.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Start with passengers floating during the brief free-fall, linking the sensation directly to astronauts circling Earth.
- Point out that both cases share locally gravity-free frames, highlighting why Einstein equated free-fall with inertial motion.
