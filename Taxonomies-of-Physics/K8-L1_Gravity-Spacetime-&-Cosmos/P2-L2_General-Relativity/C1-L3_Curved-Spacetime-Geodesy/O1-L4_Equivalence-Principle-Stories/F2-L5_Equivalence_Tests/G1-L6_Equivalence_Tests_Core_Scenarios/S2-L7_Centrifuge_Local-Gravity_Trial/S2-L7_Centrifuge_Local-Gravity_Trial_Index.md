# S2-L7_Centrifuge_Local-Gravity_Trial — Species Index
**Definition:** A rotating-arm centrifuge mimics gravity with outward normal forces so trainees feel how acceleration and weight become interchangeable.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Describe the cabin pressing on riders as the arm spins, producing a “gravity” that depends on radius and speed.
- Use it to emphasize Einstein’s message: local acceleration is indistinguishable from a gravitational pull to first approximation.
