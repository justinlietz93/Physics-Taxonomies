# O1 Equivalence-Principle Stories — Book Suggestions

These books develop the conceptual and experimental grounding of the equivalence principle.

## Conceptual Foundations
- *Relativity: The Special and the General Theory* — Albert Einstein. Original exposition of the equivalence principle and accelerated frames.
- *Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity* — James B. Hartle. Accessible storytelling linking free fall, redshift, and spacetime curvature.

## Experimental Tests
- *Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics* — Clifford M. Will. Comprehensive review of equivalence principle tests, redshift experiments, and constraints.
- *Testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle* — C.M. Will & colleagues (Living Reviews). Survey of torsion balance and space mission experiments.

## Mathematical Formulation
- *Gravitation and Spacetime* — Hans C. Ohanian & Remo Ruffini. Derives geodesic motion and tidal effects from the equivalence principle.
- *General Relativity* — Robert M. Wald. Rigorous presentation of local inertial frames, geodesic deviation, and Rindler coordinates.
