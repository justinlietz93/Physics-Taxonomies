# O1 Equivalence-Principle Stories â€” Core Equations

General relativity begins with the equivalence of gravitational and inertial effects. These equations express free-fall frames, tidal tensors, and redshift predictions stemming from the principle.

## Local Inertial Frames
**Geodesic equation:**

$$\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0$$

- Captures free-fall motion where gravity is encoded in Christoffel symbols \(\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}\).

**Metric expansion in local inertial frame:**

$$g_{\mu\nu}(x) = \eta_{\mu\nu} + \mathcal{O}((x - x_0)^2)$$

- Shows that at a point \(x_0\) one can choose coordinates making the metric Minkowskian up to tidal corrections.

## Gravitational Redshift
**Potential-based shift (weak field):**

$$\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} = -\frac{\Delta \Phi}{c^2}$$

- Frequency change between two heights depends on gravitational potential difference \(\Delta \Phi\).

**Equivalence via acceleration:**

$$\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} = \frac{a \Delta h}{c^2}$$

- In an accelerating frame with acceleration \(a\), clock rates differ by the same amount as in a gravitational field.

## Tidal Effects
**Geodesic deviation equation:**

$$\frac{D^2 \xi^\mu}{D\tau^2} = - R^\mu_{\; \alpha\beta\gamma} U^\alpha \xi^\beta U^\gamma$$

- Relates relative acceleration of nearby free-fall worldlines to curvature tensor \(R^\mu_{\; \alpha\beta\gamma}\), quantifying tidal forces.

**Newtonian tidal tensor (weak field):**

$$T_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}$$

- Links gravitational potential curvature to differential accelerations in the Newtonian limit.

## Accelerated Frames
**Rindler metric:**

$$ds^2 = -(1 + \frac{a x}{c^2})^2 c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

- Describes flat spacetime in uniformly accelerated coordinates, illustrating equivalence to a uniform gravitational field locally.
