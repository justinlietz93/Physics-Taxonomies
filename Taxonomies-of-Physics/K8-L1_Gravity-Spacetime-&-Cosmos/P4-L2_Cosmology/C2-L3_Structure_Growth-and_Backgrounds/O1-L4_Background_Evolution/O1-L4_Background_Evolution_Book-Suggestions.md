# O1 Background Evolution — Book Suggestions

These books connect background cosmology with linear growth calculations, offering both theoretical derivations and data-oriented treatments.

## Foundational Primers
- *Introduction to Cosmology* — Matts Roos. Walks through \(\Lambda\)CDM background evolution and growth factors.
- *Cosmological Inflation and Large-Scale Structure* — Andrew Liddle & David Lyth. Bridges background expansion to perturbation growth.

## Specialized Monographs
- *The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe* — P. J. E. Peebles. Classic derivations of growth equations and matter fraction evolution.
- *Dark Energy: Observational and Theoretical Approaches* — P. Ruiz-Lapuente (ed.). Explores alternative equations of state and their impact on background dynamics.

## Applied References
- *Cosmology and Large-Scale Structure* — Coles & Lucchin. Provides worked examples connecting growth factors to survey observables.
- *Euclid Red Book* — ESA. Mission design and parameter forecasts illustrating how background evolution is constrained.
