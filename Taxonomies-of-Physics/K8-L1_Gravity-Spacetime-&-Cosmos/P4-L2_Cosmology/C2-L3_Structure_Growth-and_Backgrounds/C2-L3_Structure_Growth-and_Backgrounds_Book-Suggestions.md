# C2 Structure Growth and Backgrounds — Book Suggestions

Cosmic structure grows from primordial fluctuations while backgrounds record thermal history. These references cover linear perturbation theory, CMB analysis, and large-scale structure.

## Linear Perturbations
- *Cosmological Physics* — John Peacock. Detailed treatment of growth equations and power spectra.
- *Modern Cosmology* — Scott Dodelson. Introduces Boltzmann equations and perturbation theory for CMB and matter.

## Backgrounds & Observables
- *The Cosmic Microwave Background* — Ruth Durrer. Comprehensive review of anisotropies and polarization.
- *Large-Scale Structure of the Universe* — Peebles. Classic text on clustering and correlation functions.

## Numerical & Data Analysis
- *N-Body Simulations of Cosmic Structure* — Volker Springel. Explains algorithms for nonlinear growth.
- *Statistical Methods in Cosmology* — D.J. Handley & B.D. Wandelt. Discusses parameter estimation from CMB and galaxy surveys.
