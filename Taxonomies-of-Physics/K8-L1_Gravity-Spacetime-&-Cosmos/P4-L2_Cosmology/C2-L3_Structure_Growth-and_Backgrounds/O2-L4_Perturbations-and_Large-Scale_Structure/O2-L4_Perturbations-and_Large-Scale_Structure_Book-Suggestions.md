# O2 Perturbations and Large-Scale Structure — Book Suggestions

These references focus on linear and non-linear perturbation theory, statistical clustering measures, and survey analyses that map structure growth.

## Foundational Primers
- *Modern Cosmology* — Scott Dodelson. Detailed derivations of perturbation equations, power spectra, and correlation functions.
- *Principles of Physical Cosmology* — P. J. E. Peebles. Classic statistical description of large-scale structure formation.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Large-Scale Structure of the Universe* — Shafer, Huterer & Frieman (lecture notes). Explores growth rate measurements, BAO physics, and redshift-space distortions.
- *The Cosmic Web* — J. Richard Bond & Simon White (reviews). Survey of transfer functions and non-linear evolution frameworks.

## Applied References
- *BOSS Survey Results* — SDSS Collaboration. Demonstrates how power spectra and BAO features are extracted from galaxy surveys.
- *Weak Lensing by Large-Scale Structure* — Bartelmann & Schneider. Connects perturbations to shear measurements and cosmological parameter inference.
