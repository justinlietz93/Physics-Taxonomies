# C1 Expanding Universe Stories — Book Suggestions

Cosmology charts how the universe expands, cools, and evolves. These references explain Friedmann models, observational pillars, and historical development.

## Core Cosmology Texts
- *An Introduction to Modern Cosmology* — Andrew Liddle. Concise overview of expansion history and observables.
- *Cosmology* — Steven Weinberg. Rigorous treatment of Friedmann equations, thermal history, and cosmic microwave background.

## Observational Windows
- *Observational Cosmology* — Stephen Serjeant. Discusses supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and lensing as expansion probes.
- *Planck 2018 Results* — Planck Collaboration. Benchmark dataset for cosmic parameters.

## Historical & Conceptual Narratives
- *The First Three Minutes* — Steven Weinberg. Classic narrative of early universe physics.
- *The Big Bang* — Simon Singh. Accessible history of observational breakthroughs confirming cosmic expansion.
