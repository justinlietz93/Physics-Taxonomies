# S1-L7_Dark-Energy-and-Modified-Drivers_Everyday_Snapshot — Species Index
**Definition:** Walks through Dark Energy and Modified Drivers with an airport gate briefing so the idea feels rooted in daily life.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Start inside that airport gate briefing moment, pointing to cues that stand for the dark energy and modified drivers levers.
- Invite listeners to spot the same beats the next time they stage a airport gate briefing.
