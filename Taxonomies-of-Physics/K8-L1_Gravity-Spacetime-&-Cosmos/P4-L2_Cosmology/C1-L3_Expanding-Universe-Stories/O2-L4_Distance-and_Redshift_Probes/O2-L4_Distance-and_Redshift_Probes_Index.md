# O2-L4_Distance-and_Redshift_Probes — Order Index
**Definition:** Translate luminosity distances, angular sizes, and redshifts into scale-factor tracks.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Standard_Candle_Techniques** — supernovae and other candles that fix brightness-distance links.
- **F2-L5_Standard_Ruler_and_Time_Markers** — BAO, lensing, and clock methods probing expansion.
