# O2 Distance and Redshift Probes — Book Suggestions

These resources emphasize the observational techniques and statistical tools that turn redshift measurements into cosmological distance tests.

## Foundational Primers
- *Galaxy Formation and Evolution* — Mo, van den Bosch & White. Provides background on redshift surveys and distance indicators.
- *An Introduction to Observational Cosmology* — M. H. Jones & R. J. Lambourne. Step-by-step treatment of distance ladder methods and Hubble diagrams.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Cosmological Physics* — John Peacock. Deep dive into distance measures, BAO, and lensing distances with worked examples.
- *Statistical Methods in Cosmology* — Andrew Jaffe (lecture notes). Covers parameter estimation and likelihoods for distance–redshift data.

## Applied References
- *Sloan Digital Sky Survey Technical Summary*. Documents spectroscopic survey strategies and distance indicator calibrations.
- *Dark Energy Survey Collaboration Papers*. Provide practical analyses linking luminosity distances and BAO to dark energy constraints.
