# O1 Big Bang Timeline — Core Equations

Timeline equations map the thermal and expansion history of the universe from early high-temperature epochs to recombination.

## Temperature–Time Relations
**Radiation-dominated temperature evolution:**

$$t \approx \frac{0.301}{\sqrt{g_*}} \left( \frac{M_{\text{Pl}}}{k_B T} \right)^2 \frac{\hbar}{k_B}$$

- Estimates cosmic time \(t\) at temperature \(T\) with effective relativistic degrees of freedom \(g_*\) and Planck mass \(M_{\text{Pl}}\).

**Matter–radiation equality redshift:**

$$1 + z_{\text{eq}} = \frac{\Omega_m}{\Omega_r}$$

- Gives the redshift where matter density overtakes radiation density.

## Key Epoch Scalings
**Recombination redshift:**

$$z_{\text{rec}} \approx 1089$$

- Empirical value used in background calculations, derived from detailed recombination modeling.

**Scale factor during radiation domination:**

$$a(t) \propto t^{1/2}$$

- Shows rapid early expansion when radiation dominates energy density.

**Scale factor during matter domination:**

$$a(t) \propto t^{2/3}$$

- Captures slower growth after equality, setting structure formation conditions.

## Horizon Sizes
**Particle horizon:**

$$d_H(t) = c \int_0^t \frac{dt'}{a(t')}$$

- Measures the maximum comoving distance that causal signals could travel by time \(t\).
