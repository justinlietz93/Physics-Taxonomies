# O1 Big Bang Timeline — Book Suggestions

These works detail the chronology from inflation through recombination, highlighting the physical processes that set key cosmological milestones.

## Foundational Primers
- *The First Three Minutes* — Steven Weinberg. Narrative yet quantitative overview of the early universe timeline.
- *Introduction to Cosmology* — Barbara Ryden. Accessible derivations of temperature–time relations and epoch transitions.

## Specialized Monographs
- *Particle Physics and Inflationary Cosmology* — Andrei Linde. Focus on inflationary dynamics and reheating phases at the start of the timeline.
- *The Cosmic Microwave Background* — Wayne Hu & Scott Dodelson (lecture notes). Explains recombination physics and horizon scales tied to CMB features.

## Applied References
- *Big Bang Nucleosynthesis* — G. Steigman. Connects nuclear reaction networks to observed light-element abundances along the timeline.
- *Planck Legacy Archive Documentation* — ESA. Provides data-driven constraints on recombination redshift and matter–radiation equality.
