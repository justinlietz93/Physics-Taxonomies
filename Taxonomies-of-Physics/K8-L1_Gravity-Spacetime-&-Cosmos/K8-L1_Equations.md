# K8 Gravity, Spacetime & Cosmos — Core Equations

Gravity links geometry with motion, so the kingdom-level equations highlight how spacetime curvature, energy, and cosmic content steer trajectories and expansion.

## Spacetime Structure
**Minkowski interval:**

$$(s^{2} = - c^{2} \Delta t^{2} + \Delta x^{2} + \Delta y^{2} + \Delta z^{2})$$

- The invariant interval \(s^{2}\) mixes time separation \(\Delta t\) with spatial separations \(\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z\) scaled by the speed of light \(c\), encoding flat spacetime geometry.

**Proper time:**

$$(d\tau = \sqrt{1 - \tfrac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \, dt)$$

- Proper time \(\tau\) ticks slower than coordinate time \(t\) for motion with speed \(v\), capturing time dilation in special relativity.

**Lorentz factor:**

$$(\gamma = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \tfrac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}})$$

- The dimensionless factor \(\gamma\) scales relativistic momentum, energy, and time dilation based on the speed-to-light ratio.

## Gravity as Geometry
**Einstein field equations:**

$$(G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \tfrac{8 \pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\mu\nu})$$

- The Einstein tensor \(G_{\mu\nu}\) plus cosmological constant term \(\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}\) equates spacetime curvature to the stress-energy tensor \(T_{\mu\nu}\) via Newton's constant \(G\) and the speed of light \(c\).

**Geodesic equation:**

$$(\tfrac{d^{2} x^{\lambda}}{d \tau^{2}} + \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} \tfrac{d x^{\mu}}{d \tau} \tfrac{d x^{\nu}}{d \tau} = 0)$$

- Free-fall worldlines \(x^{\lambda}(\tau)\) extremize proper time, with Christoffel symbols \(\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}\) capturing how curvature redirects motion.

**Schwarzschild radius:**

$$(r_{s} = \tfrac{2 G M}{c^{2}})$$

- The radius \(r_{s}\) marks where a mass \(M\) creates an event horizon in the Schwarzschild solution, tying geometry to gravitational collapse.

## Relativistic Energy & Momentum
**Energy-momentum relation:**

$$(E^{2} = (p c)^{2} + (m c^{2})^{2})$$

- Total energy \(E\) of a particle blends momentum \(p\) and rest mass \(m\) contributions with the light speed \(c\).

**Relativistic kinetic energy:**

$$(K = (\gamma - 1) m c^{2})$$

- Kinetic energy \(K\) exceeds the Newtonian form as \(\gamma\) grows near the speed of light.

**Momentum four-vector:**

$$(p^{\mu} = m u^{\mu})$$

- The four-momentum \(p^{\mu}\) multiplies rest mass \(m\) by the four-velocity \(u^{\mu}\), preserving conservation across frames.

## Cosmic Expansion
**Friedmann equation (curvature form):**

$$( (\tfrac{\dot{a}}{a})^{2} = \tfrac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \tfrac{k c^{2}}{a^{2}} + \tfrac{\Lambda c^{2}}{3})$$

- The expansion rate \(\dot{a}/a\) depends on energy density \(\rho\), spatial curvature index \(k\), and cosmological constant \(\Lambda\).

**Acceleration equation:**

$$(\tfrac{\ddot{a}}{a} = - \tfrac{4 \pi G}{3} (\rho + \tfrac{3 p}{c^{2}}) + \tfrac{\Lambda c^{2}}{3})$$

- Cosmic acceleration \(\ddot{a}\) reflects both energy density \(\rho\) and pressure \(p\) alongside dark-energy-like \(\Lambda\).

**Critical density:**

$$(\rho_{c} = \tfrac{3 H^{2}}{8 \pi G})$$

- The critical density \(\rho_{c}\) uses the Hubble parameter \(H = \dot{a}/a\) to separate open, flat, and closed cosmologies.

## Gravitational Waves & Radiation
**Quadrupole luminosity:**

$$(P = \tfrac{G}{5 c^{5}} \langle \dddot{Q}_{ij} \dddot{Q}^{ij} \rangle)$$

- Gravitational-wave power \(P\) scales with the time-varying mass quadrupole moments \(Q_{ij}\) and their third time derivatives.

**Strain amplitude (far field):**

$$(h \sim \tfrac{2 G}{c^{4}} \tfrac{\ddot{Q}}{r})$$

- Dimensionless strain \(h\) measured at distance \(r\) depends on the second time derivative of the source quadrupole \(\ddot{Q}\).

These relations orient the kingdom’s themes: spacetime metrics, curvature-energy interplay, relativistic motion, and how the universe expands and radiates gravity.
