# K8 Gravity, Spacetime & Cosmos — Book Suggestions

These kingdom-level books sweep through relativity, cosmology, and astrophysical gravity to give broad anchors before diving into specific phyla.

- **Einstein, *Relativity: The Special and the General Theory*.** A concise, concept-first tour of special and general relativity direct from the source, grounding spacetime intuition and curvature.
- **Misner, Thorne & Wheeler, *Gravitation*.** A comprehensive reference that bridges geometric foundations, astrophysical applications, and cosmological models across the gravity kingdom.
- **Carroll, *Spacetime and Geometry*.** Modern textbook treatment of differential geometry, Einstein’s equations, and observable predictions, ideal for linking theory to measurements.
- **Ryden, *Introduction to Cosmology*.** Focuses on the expanding universe, cosmic inventory, and observational probes, tying Friedmann dynamics to sky surveys.
- **Schutz, *A First Course in General Relativity*.** Builds computational fluency with tensors, geodesics, and gravitational waves while keeping the narrative accessible.
