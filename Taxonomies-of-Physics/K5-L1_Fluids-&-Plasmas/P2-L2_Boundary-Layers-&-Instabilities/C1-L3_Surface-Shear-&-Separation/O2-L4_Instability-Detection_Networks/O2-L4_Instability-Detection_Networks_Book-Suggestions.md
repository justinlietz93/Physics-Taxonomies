# O2 Instability Detection Networks — Book Suggestions

These references combine transition physics with sensing and signal-processing techniques for boundary-layer monitoring arrays.

## Transition and Stability Foundations
- *Stability and Transition in Shear Flows* — Schmid & Henningson. Lays out eigenvalue growth theory and amplification factors that inform sensor placement.
- *Hydrodynamic Stability* — P.G. Drazin & W.H. Reid. Provides canonical mathematical treatments of instability modes relevant to detection algorithms.

## Sensing and Data Fusion
- *Introduction to Flight Testing* — Barnes W. McCormick. Covers practical instrumentation layouts and cross-correlation methods for airborne boundary-layer measurements.
- *Sensor Array Signal Processing* — Simon Haykin. Presents covariance, beamforming, and detection frameworks adaptable to distributed shear-layer sensors.

## Applied Flow Control Networks
- *Flow Control* — McLean. Discusses instability monitoring within feedback systems aimed at delaying transition or preventing separation.
- *Active Control of Noise and Vibration* — Fuller, Elliott & Nelson. Extends adaptive filtering and feedback design principles to fluidic instability mitigation.
