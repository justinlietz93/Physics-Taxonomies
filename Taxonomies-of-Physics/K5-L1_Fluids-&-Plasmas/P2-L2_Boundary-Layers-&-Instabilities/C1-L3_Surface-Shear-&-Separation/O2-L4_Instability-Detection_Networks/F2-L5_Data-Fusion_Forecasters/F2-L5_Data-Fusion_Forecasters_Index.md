# F2-L5_Data-Fusion_Forecasters — Family Index
**Definition:** Analytics stacks that blend simple rules and smart models to warn when laminar flow is about to break.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Genus (L6) — index
- G1-L6_Reynolds-Rule_Checkers — quick calculators that raise a flag as the classic thresholds close in.
- G2-L6_Machine-Learning_Sentinels — pattern-recognition tools that learn new instability signatures on the fly.
