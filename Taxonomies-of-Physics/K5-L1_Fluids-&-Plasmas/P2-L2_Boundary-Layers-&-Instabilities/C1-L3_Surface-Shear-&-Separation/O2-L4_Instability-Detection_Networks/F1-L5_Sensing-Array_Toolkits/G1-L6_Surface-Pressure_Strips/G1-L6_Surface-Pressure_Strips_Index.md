# G1-L6_Surface-Pressure_Strips — Genus Index
**Definition:** Flexible pressure tap tapes and button sensors that trace suction peaks and separation bubbles.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Racing-Car_Pressure-Tape_Sweep — mapping suction along a racecar wing before a qualifying run.
- S2-L7_Wind-Tunnel_Tap_Check — checking a tunnel model’s pressure taps to see where separation starts.
