# O1 Boundary Layer Growth — Book Suggestions

These texts unpack how viscous layers originate and evolve along solid boundaries, mixing rigorous derivations with design heuristics.

## Classical Boundary Layer Theory
- *Boundary-Layer Theory* — Hermann Schlichting & Klaus Gersten. Provides the canonical derivations of laminar and turbulent growth along flat plates and curved surfaces.
- *Viscous Fluid Flow* — Frank M. White. Bridges differential analysis and integral methods, emphasizing wall shear stress predictions.

## Experimental and Applied Perspectives
- *Experimental Fluid Mechanics* — P.A. Davidson et al. Surveys measurement techniques for velocity profiles, shear stress, and transition diagnostics in boundary layers.
- *Fluid Mechanics Measurements* — R.J. Goldstein (ed.). Offers instrumentation and data reduction strategies tailored to thin shear layers and surface interactions.

## Engineering Correlations and Design
- *Aerodynamics for Engineers* — Bertin & Smith. Integrates boundary-layer growth with airfoil performance, including practical turbulent correlations.
- *Handbook of Hydraulics* — Brater, King, Lindell & Wei. Supplies empirical charts and correction factors for boundary-layer effects on hydraulic structures.
