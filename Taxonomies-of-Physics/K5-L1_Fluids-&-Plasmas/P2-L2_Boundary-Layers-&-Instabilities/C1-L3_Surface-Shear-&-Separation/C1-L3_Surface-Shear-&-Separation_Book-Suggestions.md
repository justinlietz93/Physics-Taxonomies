# C1 Surface Shear & Separation — Book Suggestions

Boundary layers control drag and lift, while separation dictates wake formation. These sources explain shear stress buildup, transition, and strategies to delay separation.

## Boundary Layer Fundamentals
- *Boundary-Layer Theory* — Hermann Schlichting & Klaus Gersten. Classic text on laminar and turbulent boundary layers, separation criteria, and control methods.
- *Viscous Fluid Flow* — Frank M. White. Provides derivations and engineering correlations for wall shear stress and separation prediction.

## Transition & Control
- *Laminar-Turbulent Transition* — R. Narasimha & H. Fasel (eds.). Surveys instability mechanisms that trigger separation under different pressure gradients.
- *Flow Control* — Mohamed Gad-el-Hak. Covers passive and active techniques for manipulating surface shear and delaying separation.

## Measurement & Visualization
- *Boundary-Layer and Flow Control* — Lachmann (ed.). Compendium of experiments illustrating separation bubbles and reattachment.
- *Modern Experimental Fluid Mechanics* — G.P. King et al. Details PIV and surface sensing methods to characterize shear layers.
