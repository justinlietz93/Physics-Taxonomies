# P2–L2 Boundary Layers & Instabilities
**Definition:** Thin fluid skins that cling to surfaces, sometimes peeling into flutters or vortices when pushed too hard.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- C1-L3_Surface-Shear-&-Separation — how surfaces drag on flows and the signals that trigger peel-off.
- C2-L3_Instability-Trigger_Diagnostics — sensing and experiments that pinpoint the moment calm skins go unstable.
