# O1 Disturbance Tracking Methods — Book Suggestions

These resources blend instability theory with estimation techniques to help practitioners monitor triggering disturbances in boundary layers.

## Theory and Modeling
- *Instabilities, Chaos and Turbulence* — Paul Manneville. Explains receptivity and modal interactions that underpin tracking algorithms.
- *Transition in Turbines* — R.S. Bunker & H. Dunn. Applies instability modeling to blade passages, demonstrating practical tracking metrics.

## Estimation and Filtering
- *Applied Optimal Estimation* — Gelb (ed.). Introduces Kalman filtering and state estimation tools for reconstructing disturbance fields from sparse sensors.
- *Stochastic Processes and Filtering Theory* — Andrew H. Jazwinski. Supplies continuous and discrete filtering formulations relevant to instability monitoring.

## Measurement Techniques
- *Laser Doppler and Phase Doppler Measurement Techniques* — Albrecht et al. Details instrumentation for capturing small-amplitude velocity fluctuations in boundary layers.
- *Hot-Wire Anemometry* — L.M. Breuer & P. Kaballo. Provides calibration and data processing guidance for high-bandwidth disturbance sensing.
