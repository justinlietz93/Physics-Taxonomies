# C2-L3_Instability-Trigger_Diagnostics — Class Index
**Definition:** Tools and experiments that reveal exactly when boundary layers tip from calm attachment into instability.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Order (L4) — index
- O1-L4_Disturbance-Tracking_Methods — in-situ sensing suites that spot the first wiggles on surfaces or in flow.
- O2-L4_Controlled-Onset_Experiments — deliberate tests that trigger transition to study and tame it.
