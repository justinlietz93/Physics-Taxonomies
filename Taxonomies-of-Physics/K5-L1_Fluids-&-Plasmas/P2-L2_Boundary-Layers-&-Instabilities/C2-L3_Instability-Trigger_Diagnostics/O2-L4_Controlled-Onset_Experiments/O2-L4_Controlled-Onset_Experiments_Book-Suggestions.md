# O2 Controlled Onset Experiments — Book Suggestions

These books guide the design of experiments that purposefully trigger or delay transition via calibrated forcing devices.

## Experimental Techniques
- *Boundary-Layer Transition and Control* — Ramis & Arnal (eds.). Compiles laboratory methods for acoustic, suction, and roughness-induced onset studies.
- *Experimental Fluid Mechanics* — K. Eckert et al. Discusses forcing apparatus, uncertainty quantification, and diagnostics for controlled instability tests.

## Actuator Technologies
- *Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma Actuators* — Thomas Corke et al. Explains plasma actuator physics, power requirements, and performance metrics for transition control.
- *Synthetic Jets and Their Applications* — Grzegorz Żywica. Covers design equations for zero-net-mass-flux jets used to trigger or suppress boundary-layer disturbances.

## Data Analysis and Interpretation
- *Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences* — Bevington & Robinson. Provides statistical tools to interpret onset shifts and confidence intervals.
- *Signal Processing for Intelligent Sensor Systems with MATLAB* — David C. Swanson. Offers practical scripts for extracting intermittency, spectra, and coherence from experimental data.
