# G1-L6_Bleed-and_Suction_Modules — Genus Index
**Definition:** Benchtop fixtures that inject or remove fluid to mimic real-world bleed and suction control tricks.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Bleed-Slot_Tabletop_Rig — building a small bleed slot to show separation delay.
- S2-L7_Suction-Panel_Student_Lab — classroom suction panel labs that reveal attachment recovery.
