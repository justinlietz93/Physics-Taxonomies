# O2 Controlled Onset Experiments â€” Core Equations

Deliberate excitation of boundary layers or shear flows uses calibrated actuators whose forcing levels and frequencies are tuned against natural stability characteristics.

## Forcing Amplitude Calibration
**Acoustic excitation level:**

$$SPL = 20 \log_{10}\left(\frac{p'}{p_0}\right) \text{ dB}$$

- Converts measured pressure fluctuation amplitude \(p'\) to a standardized sound pressure level referenced to \(p_0 = 20 \ \mu\text{Pa}\).

## Momentum Coefficient for Blowing/Suction
**Actuator authority metric:**

$$C_\mu = \frac{\dot{m}_j V_j}{\tfrac{1}{2} \rho_\infty U_\infty^2 c}$$

- Quantifies jet momentum input \(\dot{m}_j V_j\) relative to freestream dynamic pressure over characteristic chord \(c\), comparing different actuation strategies.

## Frequency Matching to Unstable Modes
**Reduced frequency parameter:**

$$F^+ = \frac{f c}{U_\infty}$$

- Non-dimensionalizes actuation frequency \(f\) with chord \(c\) and freestream velocity \(U_\infty\) to align forcing with dominant instability bands.

## Plasma or Thermal Actuator Power
**Power density estimate:**

$$q'' = \frac{P_{\text{input}}}{A_{\text{actuator}}}$$

- Relates supplied electrical power \(P_{\text{input}}\) to actuator area \(A_{\text{actuator}}\), guiding comparisons between heating-based and momentum-based excitation.

## Transition Location Tracking
**Intermittency definition:**

$$\gamma(x) = \frac{t_{\text{turbulent}}}{t_{\text{total}}}$$

- Measures the fraction of time a probe experiences turbulent flow at position \(x\), revealing how controlled forcing shifts onset downstream or upstream.
