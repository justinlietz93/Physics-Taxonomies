# C2 Instability Trigger Diagnostics — Book Suggestions

Diagnosing when flows transition or become unstable requires linear stability tools and experiments. These references focus on detecting triggers and interpreting instability signatures.

## Linear Stability Theory
- *Hydrodynamic Stability* — P.G. Drazin & W.H. Reid. Canonical text covering Orr–Sommerfeld analysis and modal growth rates.
- *Stability and Transition in Shear Flows* — Peter J. Schmid & Dan S. Henningson. Introduces both modal and non-modal stability frameworks.

## Experimental Diagnostics
- *Flow Visualization* — Albert J. Smits & Tamas H. G. van Doorne. Provides visualization techniques for spotting instability onset in boundary layers and jets.
- *Laser Doppler and Phase Doppler Measurement Techniques* — H.-E. Albrecht et al. Details velocity diagnostics sensitive to oscillatory precursors.

## Nonlinear Evolution & Control
- *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* — Steven H. Strogatz. Offers bifurcation tools to interpret post-critical behavior and subcritical transitions.
- *Instability and Transition to Turbulence* — Takeshi Hayase & S. Kuwabara. Discusses control strategies and feedback diagnostics for delaying instability.
