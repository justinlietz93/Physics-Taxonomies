# P5–L2 Geophysical & Astro Fluids
**Definition:** Rotating, stratified, or self-gravitating flows that shape planets, weather systems, and cosmic disks.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- C1-L3_Rotation-&-Stratification — balances among Coriolis forces, buoyancy, and pressure in layered flows.
- **C2-L3_Planetary_Flow_Structures** — organizes rotating stratified flows that shape planets and stars.
