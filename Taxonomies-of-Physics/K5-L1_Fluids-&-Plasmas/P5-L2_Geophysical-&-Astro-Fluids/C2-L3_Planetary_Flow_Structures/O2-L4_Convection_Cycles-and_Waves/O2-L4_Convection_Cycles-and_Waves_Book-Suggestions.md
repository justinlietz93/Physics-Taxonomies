# O2 Convection Cycles & Waves — Book Suggestions

These works cover the coupling of convection with planetary-scale oscillations and wave phenomena.

## Atmospheric Convection
- *Atmospheric Convection* — Kerry Emanuel. Explains CAPE, convective parameterization, and interactions with large-scale waves.
- *Cloud Dynamics* — Robert A. Houze Jr. Provides observational and theoretical perspectives on convective life cycles.

## Intraseasonal and Planetary Oscillations
- *The Madden–Julian Oscillation* — Matthew Wheeler & Harry Hendon. Reviews skeleton models and observational diagnostics for tropical intraseasonal variability.
- *Large-Scale Atmospheric Variability* — Tamara Benmarhnia (ed.). Discusses Kelvin waves, equatorial Rossby modes, and their coupling to convection.

## Stellar and Planetary Convection
- *Stellar Structure and Evolution* — Kippenhahn, Weigert & Weiss. Details convection criteria and pulsation modes in stars.
- *Fluid Dynamics of Planetary Interiors* — Sabine Stanley & Jonathan Aurnou. Explores rotating convection and wave interactions in giant planets.
