# O1 Jetstreams and Gyre Systems — Book Suggestions

These sources analyze persistent zonal jets and oceanic gyres shaped by planetary rotation and wind forcing.

## Atmospheric Jets
- *The General Circulation of the Atmosphere* — Lorenz & Holton (eds.). Summarizes jetstream dynamics, thermal wind, and eddy momentum fluxes.
- *Jet Streams of the Atmosphere* — Uccellini & Koch. Provides observational studies and theoretical foundations of jet formation.

## Ocean Gyres
- *Ocean Circulation* — Open University. Explains Sverdrup balances, boundary currents, and wind-driven gyre structure.
- *Wind-Driven Ocean Circulation* — Henry Stommel. Classic monograph on western boundary intensification and gyre dynamics.

## Wave–Mean Flow Interactions
- *Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics* — Adrian Gill. Links eddy stresses, PV staircases, and jet maintenance across the coupled system.
- *Large-Scale Atmospheric and Oceanic Processes* — Norbert Untersteiner (ed.). Collects studies on eddy-mean interactions sustaining planetary jets.
