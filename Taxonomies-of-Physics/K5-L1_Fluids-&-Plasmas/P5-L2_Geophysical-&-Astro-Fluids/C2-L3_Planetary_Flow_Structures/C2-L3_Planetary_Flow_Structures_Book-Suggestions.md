# C2 Planetary Flow Structures — Book Suggestions

Planets host jets, vortices, and circulation cells shaped by rotation and stratification. These books explore planetary atmospheres, giant storms, and magnetic coupling.

## Atmospheric Dynamics
- *Dynamic Meteorology of the Stratosphere and Mesosphere* — Andrew F. Nagy. Describes planetary wave structures and circulation cells.
- *An Introduction to Planetary Atmospheres* — Agustin Sánchez-Lavega. Surveys atmospheric circulation, jets, and vortices across the solar system.

## Giant Planet Phenomena
- *Saturn’s Great Storm and Other Dynamic Atmospheres* — Leigh Fletcher. Examines long-lived vortices and oscillations.
- *Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere* — Bagenal, Dowling & McKinnon (eds.). Includes detailed sections on the Great Red Spot and zonal jets.

## Coupled Interior–Atmosphere Models
- *Planetary Magnetism* — U.R. Christensen & A. Balogh (eds.). Discusses magnetohydrodynamic coupling influencing planetary flows.
- *Fluid Dynamics of Planetary Interiors* — Sabine Stanley & Jeremy Bloxham. Provides insights into convection-driven zonal flows and dynamo interactions.
