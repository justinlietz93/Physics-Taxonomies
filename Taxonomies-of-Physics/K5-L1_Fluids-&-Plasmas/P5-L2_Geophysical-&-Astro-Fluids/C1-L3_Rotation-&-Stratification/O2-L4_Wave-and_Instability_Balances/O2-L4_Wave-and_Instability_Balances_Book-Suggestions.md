# O2 Wave and Instability Balances — Book Suggestions

These texts explore Rossby and gravity waves alongside baroclinic instabilities in rotating stratified fluids.

## Planetary Wave Dynamics
- *Waves in the Atmosphere* — S. Chapman & R.S. Lindzen. Covers Rossby and gravity wave theory with dispersion relations.
- *Introduction to Geophysical Fluid Dynamics* — Benoit Cushman-Roisin & Jean-Marie Beckers. Provides quasi-geostrophic PV equations and wave solutions.

## Instability Analysis
- *Baroclinic Instability and Ocean Fronts* — X.B. Wu & M. Subramanian. Focuses on Eady growth rates and necessary conditions for instability.
- *Atmospheric Turbulence and Mesoscale Meteorology* — Skamarock, Melott & Durran (eds.). Includes modern perspectives on wave–instability balances.

## Observational and Modeling Contexts
- *Large-Scale Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics* — J.C. McWilliams. Connects theory to numerical simulations of Rossby waves and baroclinic eddies.
- *Gravity Wave Processes* — Fritts & Alexander. Documents measurement techniques and parameterizations for internal gravity waves.
