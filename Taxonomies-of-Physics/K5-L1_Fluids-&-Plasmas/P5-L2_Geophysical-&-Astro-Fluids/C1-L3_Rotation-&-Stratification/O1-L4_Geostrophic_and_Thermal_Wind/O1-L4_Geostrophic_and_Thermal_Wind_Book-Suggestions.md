# O1 Geostrophic and Thermal Wind — Book Suggestions

These texts focus on rotating stratified flows where geostrophic balance and thermal wind shear dominate.

## Atmospheric Dynamics
- *An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology* — James R. Holton. Derives geostrophic and thermal wind relations with meteorological applications.
- *Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics* — Geoffrey K. Vallis. Provides comprehensive treatment of rotating stratified dynamics, including Rossby numbers.

## Ocean Circulation
- *Descriptive Physical Oceanography* — Pickard & Emery. Connects geostrophic currents to observed ocean density fields.
- *Ocean Circulation and Climate* — Siedler, Griffies, Gould & Church (eds.). Discusses thermal wind balance in global circulation models.

## Data Analysis and Observation
- *Atmospheric Data Analysis* — Roger Daley. Shows how geostrophic diagnostics support data assimilation and reanalysis.
- *Satellite Altimetry and Earth Sciences* — L.-L. Fu & A. Cazenave. Demonstrates retrieval of geostrophic currents from sea surface height gradients.
