# C1 Rotation & Stratification — Book Suggestions

Geophysical and astrophysical flows balance Coriolis forces with buoyancy. These references develop geostrophy, stratified turbulence, and wave dynamics.

## Rotating Fluids
- *Geophysical Fluid Dynamics* — Joseph Pedlosky. Foundations of geostrophic balance, quasi-geostrophic theory, and Rossby waves.
- *Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics* — Adrian Gill. Covers rotating shallow-water models and large-scale circulation.

## Stratification & Waves
- *An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology* — James R. Holton. Introduces buoyancy oscillations, Brunt–Väisälä frequency, and internal gravity waves.
- *Internal Gravity Waves* — Michael E. McIntyre. Focuses on wave propagation and energy transport in stratified layers.

## Numerical & Observational Tools
- *Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics* — Dale Durran. Addresses time-stepping and balance-aware schemes for rotating, stratified flows.
- *Observing the Oceans in Real Time* — Glenn S. Wilson (ed.). Discusses remote sensing and profiling techniques for stratified rotating systems.
