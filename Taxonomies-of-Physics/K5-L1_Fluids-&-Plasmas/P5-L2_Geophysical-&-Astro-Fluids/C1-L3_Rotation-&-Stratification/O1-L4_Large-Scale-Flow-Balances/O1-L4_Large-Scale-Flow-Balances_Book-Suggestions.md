# O1 Large-Scale Flow Balances — Book Suggestions

These references integrate geostrophic, hydrostatic, and planetary wave balances for global-scale flows.

## Planetary Fluid Dynamics
- *Large-Scale Atmospheric Circulation* — Taroh Matsuno. Explores primitive equations, Rossby waves, and balance models.
- *Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics* — Adrian E. Gill. Classic treatment of coupled atmosphere–ocean balances, including Sverdrup transport.

## Observational Syntheses
- *The Global Circulation of the Atmosphere* — Schneider & Sobel (eds.). Combines theory with observations for planetary-scale balances.
- *Ocean Circulation and Climate* — Gerold Siedler et al. Provides wind-driven gyre analyses and Ekman transport diagnostics.

## Modeling Techniques
- *Numerical Modeling of the Global Atmosphere in the Climate System* — Phillips et al. Details balanced model initialization and primitive equation solvers.
- *Geophysical Fluid Dynamics* — Joseph Pedlosky. Offers rigorous derivations of potential vorticity conservation and large-scale approximations.
