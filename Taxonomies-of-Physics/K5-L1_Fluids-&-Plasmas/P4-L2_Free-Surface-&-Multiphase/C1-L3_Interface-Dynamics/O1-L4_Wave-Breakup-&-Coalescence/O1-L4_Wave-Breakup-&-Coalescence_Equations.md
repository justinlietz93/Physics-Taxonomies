# O1 Wave Breakup & Coalescence — Core Equations

When surface waves steepen, capillary and gravitational forces determine whether crests shed droplets or merge.

## Dispersion Relation for Gravity–Capillary Waves
**Deep water dispersion:**

$$\omega^2 = gk + \frac{\sigma}{\rho} k^3$$

- Combines gravity \(g\) and surface tension \(\sigma\) contributions to angular frequency \(\omega\) at wavenumber \(k\).

## Wave Steepness Criterion
**Breaking threshold:**

$$S = \frac{H}{\lambda} \gtrsim 0.14$$

- Empirical steepness \(S\) indicates when wave height \(H\) relative to wavelength \(\lambda\) reaches the spilling or plunging breakup limit.

## Droplet Weber Number
**Breakup indicator:**

$$We = \frac{\rho U^2 d}{\sigma}$$

- Compares inertia \(\rho U^2\) to surface tension \(\sigma\) for droplets of diameter \(d\); values above \(\sim 12\) often lead to breakup.

## Coalescence Time Scale
**Film drainage estimate:**

$$t_c \approx \frac{3 \mu R^2}{2 \sigma h_0}$$

- Approximates the time \(t_c\) for two droplets of radius \(R\) with initial film thickness \(h_0\) to coalesce as the film drains with viscosity \(\mu\).

## Energy Flux in Breaking Waves
**Wave energy transport:**

$$P = E c_g = \frac{1}{8} \rho g H^2 c_g$$

- Expresses power per unit crest length as energy density \(E\) times group velocity \(c_g\), indicating available energy for breakup sprays.
