# O1 Wave Breakup & Coalescence — Book Suggestions

These resources investigate how surface waves fragment into droplets or merge depending on curvature, inertia, and surface chemistry.

## Wave Dynamics Foundations
- *Surface Waves and Fluxes* — G.L. Mellor. Explains gravity–capillary dispersion and wave energy transport relevant to breakup.
- *Ocean Waves and Oscillating Systems* — Johannes Falnes. Covers wave steepness and energy flux concepts for engineering contexts.

## Breakup and Spray Formation
- *Atomization and Sprays* — Lefebvre & McDonell. Details Weber number criteria, droplet breakup modes, and energy budgets.
- *Liquid Atomization* — L. Bayvel & Z. Orzechowski. Provides correlations for droplet size distributions and breakup thresholds.

## Coalescence and Film Drainage
- *Drops and Bubbles in Interfacial Research* — R. Chhabra & D. De Kee. Discusses coalescence dynamics, film thinning, and surfactant effects.
- *Capillary Flows in Heterogeneous Media* — B. Verneuil & E. Dressaire. Explores capillary-driven coalescence in porous and structured interfaces.
