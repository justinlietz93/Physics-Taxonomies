# O1 Surface Tension Balances — Core Equations

Surface tension controls curvature-driven pressure jumps and characteristic length scales for free surfaces.

## Young–Laplace Relation
**Pressure jump across a curved interface:**

$$\Delta P = \sigma \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)$$

- Links surface tension \(\sigma\) and principal radii of curvature \(R_1, R_2\) to pressure difference across a liquid surface.

## Capillary Length
**Gravity versus surface tension balance:**

$$\ell_c = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho g}}$$

- Defines the length scale \(\ell_c\) where gravitational forces \(\rho g\) and surface tension \(\sigma\) contribute equally.

## Contact Angle and Wetting
**Young's equation:**

$$\sigma_{SG} = \sigma_{SL} + \sigma \cos \theta$$

- Relates solid–gas \(\sigma_{SG}\), solid–liquid \(\sigma_{SL}\), and liquid–gas \(\sigma\) surface tensions to equilibrium contact angle \(\theta\).

## Capillary Pressure in Tubes
**Rise height:**

$$h = \frac{2 \sigma \cos \theta}{\rho g r}$$

- Gives the static rise height \(h\) of a liquid in a tube of radius \(r\), showing how wetting and curvature set pressure differences.

## Dimensionless Groups
**Capillary number:**

$$Ca = \frac{\mu U}{\sigma}$$

- Compares viscous forces \(\mu U\) to surface tension \(\sigma\), indicating when capillarity dominates interface dynamics.
