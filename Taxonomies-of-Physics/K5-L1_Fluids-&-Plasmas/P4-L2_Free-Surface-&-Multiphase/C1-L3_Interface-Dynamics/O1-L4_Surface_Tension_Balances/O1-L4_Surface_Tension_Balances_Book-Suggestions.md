# O1 Surface Tension Balances — Book Suggestions

These references explain how surface tension drives curvature pressures, wetting, and small-scale fluid shaping.

## Fundamentals of Capillarity
- *Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena* — de Gennes, Brochard-Wyart & Quéré. Provides modern treatments of Young–Laplace balance and contact line physics.
- *Interfacial Phenomena* — Milton Kerker. Covers thermodynamics and mechanics of interfaces, including capillary pressure formulas.

## Applications and Measurements
- *Surface and Interfacial Tension: Measurement, Theory, and Applications* — Stanley Hartland (ed.). Discusses experimental methods for quantifying surface tension and curvature.
- *Microscale and Nanoscale Heat Transfer* — Satish Kandlikar et al. Applies capillary balancing to microchannels and wicking structures.

## Engineering Contexts
- *Transport Phenomena* — Bird, Stewart & Lightfoot. Integrates dimensionless groups like the capillary number into design problems.
- *Handbook of Surface and Colloid Chemistry* — K. Somasundaran (ed.). Offers data and models for surface tension management in industrial processes.
