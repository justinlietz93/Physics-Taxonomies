# O2 Breakup and Coalescence Regimes — Book Suggestions

These books map the regimes governing droplet breakup and coalescence across industrial and natural flows.

## Regime Mapping and Theory
- *Drop-Surface Interactions* — M. Rein & J. Roisman. Discusses Weber–Ohnesorge maps and impact outcomes.
- *Turbulent Multiphase Flows* — Crowe, Schwarzkopf, Sommerfeld & Tsuji. Provides population balance models and breakup kernels for sprays and bubbly flows.

## Computational and Modeling Tools
- *Computational Methods for Multiphase Flow* — Prosperetti & Tryggvason. Covers numerical treatment of surface tension and coalescence dynamics.
- *Population Balances: Theory and Applications* — Ramkrishna & Mahoney. Explains number density equations for aggregating and fragmenting systems.

## Applied Contexts
- *Spray Technology Reference Guide* — Spraying Systems Co. Offers engineering correlations for atomization regimes in manufacturing.
- *Foams and Emulsions* — Prud'homme & Khan (eds.). Presents coalescence control strategies in chemical and food processes.
