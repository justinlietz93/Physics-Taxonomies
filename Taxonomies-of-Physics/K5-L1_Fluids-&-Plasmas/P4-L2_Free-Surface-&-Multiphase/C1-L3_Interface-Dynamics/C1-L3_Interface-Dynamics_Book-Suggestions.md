# C1 Interface Dynamics — Book Suggestions

Free surfaces and phase interfaces reshape under gravity, surface tension, and flow. These resources examine kinematics, capillarity, and instabilities of interfaces.

## Fundamentals
- *Capillarity and Wetting Phenomena* — Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Françoise Brochard-Wyart & David Quéré. Explores surface tension, contact lines, and interface shapes.
- *Free-Surface Hydrodynamics* — Jean-Michel Vanden-Broeck. Focuses on potential flow solutions for surface waves, jets, and cavities.

## Multiphase Models
- *Computational Methods for Multiphase Flow* — Andrea Prosperetti & Grétar Tryggvason. Introduces volume-of-fluid and level-set techniques for interface tracking.
- *Interfacial Transport Phenomena* — John C. Slattery, Leonard Sagis & Eun-Soo Oh. Connects thermodynamics with mass, momentum, and energy transfer across interfaces.

## Instabilities & Applications
- *Hydrodynamic Instabilities* — François Charru. Covers Rayleigh–Taylor, Kelvin–Helmholtz, and Marangoni instabilities that sculpt interfaces.
- *Microfluidics: Technologies and Applications* — Nam-Trung Nguyen & Steven Wereley. Demonstrates interface control in lab-on-a-chip systems.
