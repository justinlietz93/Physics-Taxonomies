# C2 Interface Dynamics and Wave Interaction — Book Suggestions

When waves interact with interfaces, they exchange energy, refract, and couple modes across phases. These references emphasize wave–current interaction, interfacial resonances, and numerical modeling.

## Wave–Current Interaction
- *Ocean Surface Waves: Their Physics and Prediction* — Jerome Williams. Covers wave–current refraction, shoaling, and breaking at interfaces.
- *Wave Interaction with Fluid Structures* — Mark Peter Païdoussis & Stuart Price. Analyzes how compliant boundaries respond to wave loading.

## Multiphase Wave Modeling
- *Nonlinear Waves in Fluids* — Roger Grimshaw. Discusses interfacial solitons, resonant triads, and coupled-mode theory.
- *Theory and Applications of Ocean Surface Waves* — Chiang C. Mei. Provides perturbation approaches for waves over layered media and variable depth.

## Numerical Simulation
- *Spectral Methods in Fluid Dynamics* — Claudio Canuto et al. Presents spectral techniques for capturing wave–interface coupling with high fidelity.
- *Numerical Modeling of Water Waves* — Charles L. Mader. Demonstrates finite-difference and volume-of-fluid approaches for nonlinear wave interactions.
