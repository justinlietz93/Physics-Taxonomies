# O1 Capillary and Gravity Waves — Book Suggestions

These works examine the spectrum of waves shaped by gravity and surface tension, from ripples to swells.

## Theoretical Foundations
- *Waves in Fluids* — James Lighthill. Provides dispersion relations, group velocity, and nonlinear interaction theory for surface waves.
- *The Physics of Fluids and Plasmas* — Arnab Rai Choudhuri. Offers clear derivations of wave equations and force balance parameters.

## Experimental and Observational Studies
- *Water Waves: The Mathematical Theory with Applications* — J.J. Stoker. Combines theory with laboratory and ocean observations.
- *An Introduction to Ocean Turbulence* — S. Thorpe. Includes measurement techniques and damping analyses for small-scale waves.

## Engineering Applications
- *Coastal Engineering Manual* — U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Presents practical wave prediction and design methods incorporating capillary and gravity effects.
- *Wave Motion in Elastic Solids and Fluids* — Michel Destrade & Ray Ogden. Connects wave behavior to structural interactions in marine systems.
