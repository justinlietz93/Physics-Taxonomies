# O1 Capillary and Gravity Waves — Core Equations

Interface waves span scales from centimeter ripples dominated by surface tension to ocean swells governed by gravity.

## Dispersion Relation
**Combined gravity–capillary waves:**

$$\omega^2 = gk \tanh(kh) + \frac{\sigma}{\rho} k^3 \tanh(kh)$$

- Describes angular frequency \(\omega\) as a function of wavenumber \(k\), depth \(h\), gravity \(g\), and surface tension \(\sigma\).

## Phase and Group Velocity
**Velocity expressions:**

$$c = \frac{\omega}{k}, \qquad c_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}$$

- Provide propagation speed of wave crests \(c\) and energy packets \(c_g\), highlighting dispersive behavior.

## Damping of Capillary Waves
**Viscous attenuation rate:**

$$\alpha = 2 \nu k^2$$

- Gives exponential decay coefficient \(\alpha\) for amplitude due to viscosity \(\nu\) in small-amplitude capillary waves.

## Resonant Triad Interactions
**Frequency matching:**

$$\omega_1 + \omega_2 = \omega_3, \qquad \mathbf{k}_1 + \mathbf{k}_2 = \mathbf{k}_3$$

- Conditions for nonlinear wave coupling and energy transfer among modes.

## Froude and Bond Numbers
**Dominant force identification:**

$$Fr = \frac{U}{\sqrt{gL}}, \qquad Bo = \frac{\rho g L^2}{\sigma}$$

- Compare inertial speed \(U\) with gravity and surface tension to determine whether waves behave as gravity or capillary dominated.
