# C2 Shock Formation and Propagation — Book Suggestions

Shocks form when information cannot outrun flow gradients, producing abrupt jumps. These resources cover shock jump conditions, thickness, and propagation in gases and plasmas.

## Shock Theory
- *Elements of Gasdynamics* — Liepmann & Roshko. Classic reference on normal and oblique shock relations, shock polar analysis, and wave interactions.
- *Shock Waves and Explosions* — Stanley K. H. Lam. Discusses shock formation, propagation, and blast-wave modeling.

## Numerical & Experimental Tools
- *Computational Fluid Dynamics* — John D. Anderson Jr. Introduces shock-capturing schemes and numerical stabilization techniques.
- *Shock Wave Science and Technology Reference Library* — Y. B. Zeldovich & Y. P. Raizer (eds.). Provides experimental methods and diagnostic techniques for shock measurements.

## Applications
- *Detonation Physics* — Jack D. Zukas (ed.). Connects shock propagation to reactive flows and explosive engineering.
- *Plasma Shock Waves* — Hans Schamel. Explores collisionless shocks and wave steepening in plasma environments.
