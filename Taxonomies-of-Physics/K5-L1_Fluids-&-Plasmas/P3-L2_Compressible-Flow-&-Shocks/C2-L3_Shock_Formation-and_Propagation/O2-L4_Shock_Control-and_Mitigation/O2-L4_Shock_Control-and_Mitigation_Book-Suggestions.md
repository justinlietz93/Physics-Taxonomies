# O2 Shock Control and Mitigation — Book Suggestions

These titles explore engineering tactics for weakening, relocating, or absorbing shock waves in aerodynamic and propulsion systems.

## Inlet and Duct Control
- *Supersonic Inlet Design* — Alan Pope & John Goin. Describes bleed systems, variable-geometry ramps, and shock positioning methods.
- *Hypersonic Airbreathing Propulsion* — William H. Heiser & David T. Pratt. Examines shock control strategies for scramjet and ramjet inlets.

## Active Flow Control
- *Active Flow Control* — Rudibert King (ed.). Presents suction, blowing, plasma, and synthetic jet techniques for shock-boundary-layer interaction mitigation.
- *Flow Control by Feedback* — Isaac Cattafesta et al. Integrates sensors and actuators for real-time shock management.

## Structural and Protective Measures
- *Blast Mitigation Strategies in Marine Composite and Sandwich Structures* — Srinivasan Gopalakrishnan et al. Provides venting and energy absorption concepts applicable to shock relief panels.
- *Protective Relaying for Power Generation Systems* — Donald Reimert. Discusses pressure relief and venting designs that can be adapted to manage shock-induced surges in piping.
