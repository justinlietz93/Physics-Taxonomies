# O1 Shock Structure and Jump Conditions — Book Suggestions

These texts develop the conservation-law foundations and microscopic structure of shock waves.

## Fundamental Gasdynamics
- *Gas Dynamics* — Zucrow & Hoffman. Derives Rankine–Hugoniot relations and analyzes shock layers in detail.
- *Fundamentals of Gas Dynamics* — V. Ganesan. Provides systematic treatments of normal and oblique shocks with worked examples.

## Kinetic and Microscopic Perspectives
- *The Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Compressible Fluid Flow* — Ascher Shapiro. Bridges continuum jump conditions with molecular interpretations of shock thickness.
- *Kinetic Theory of Gases* — Waldmann & Trübenbacher. Examines collisional transport processes that control shock internal structure.

## High-Speed Measurement Techniques
- *Shock Waves and Explosion Phenomena* — A. Kuhl et al. Surveys diagnostics for capturing shock fronts and verifying jump relations.
- *Diagnostics for Hypersonic Reentry* — Iain Boyd & Thierry Magin. Discusses modern instrumentation for resolving thin shock layers in rarefied flows.
