# O2 Sonic Boom and Structure Interaction — Book Suggestions

These sources detail how sonic booms propagate and how structures respond to their overpressure signatures.

## Sonic Boom Propagation
- *Sonic Boom: Theory and Prediction* — Dominic J. Maglieri et al. Presents atmospheric propagation models and waveform shaping strategies.
- *Fundamentals of Aerodynamics* — John D. Anderson. Includes sonic boom derivations tied to supersonic aircraft geometry.

## Structural Dynamics under Transient Loads
- *Dynamics of Structures* — Anil K. Chopra. Covers single and multi-degree-of-freedom responses to impulsive pressure loads.
- *Blast Effects on Buildings* — Geoffrey Mays. Translates overpressure histories into structural damage assessments relevant to boom impacts.

## Environmental and Community Impact
- *Aviation and the Environment: Designing a Quiet Air Transport System* — National Academies. Discusses regulatory criteria and community response metrics for sonic booms.
- *Handbook of Noise and Vibration Control* — Malcolm Crocker (ed.). Provides tools for evaluating and mitigating acoustic impacts from transient events.
