- *Shock Waves and Explosions* — Guderley. Provides foundational analysis of intersecting shocks and their evolution.

## Expansion Fan Applications
- *Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves* — Courant & Friedrichs. Explains Prandtl–Meyer theory and composite fan constructions in detail.
- *Compressible Fluid Flow* — Michel A. Saad. Offers engineering treatments of expansion fan design and property calculations.

## Numerical and Experimental Studies
- *Gas Dynamics of Explosions* — Shapiro, Glass, & Penner. Includes computational and experimental case studies on multiple shock systems.
- *Handbook of Supersonic Aerodynamics* — Naval Research Laboratory. Aggregates charts and data for shock and expansion fan configurations in practical geometries.
