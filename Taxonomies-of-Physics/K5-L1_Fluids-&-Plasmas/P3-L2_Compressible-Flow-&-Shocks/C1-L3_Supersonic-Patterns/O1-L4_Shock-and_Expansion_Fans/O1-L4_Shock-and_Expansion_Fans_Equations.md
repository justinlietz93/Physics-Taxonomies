# O1 Shock and Expansion Fans — Core Equations

When supersonic flows negotiate corners, successive shocks or expansion fans combine to satisfy overall turning angles while maintaining compatibility conditions between regions.

## Multiple Oblique Shock Compatibility
**Pressure equality across junction:**

$$P_2 = P_3$$

- For intersecting shocks, downstream static pressures must match, constraining feasible combinations of shock angles and strengths.

## Sequential Prandtl–Meyer Turns
**Net turning angle:**

$$\Delta \theta = \nu(M_2) - \nu(M_1)$$

- Uses the Prandtl–Meyer function \(\nu(M)\) to accumulate expansion from region 1 to region 2, ensuring intermediate fans integrate to the desired deflection.

## Shock Polar Intersection
**Polar equation:**

$$\frac{P}{P_1} = 1 + \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma + 1}(M_1^2 \sin^2 \beta - 1)$$

- Defines a curve in \(P/P_1\) versus flow deflection space; intersections of two polars indicate compatible shock reflections or Mach stems.

## Mach Reflection Criteria
**Detachment condition:**

$$\theta_{\text{crit}} \approx \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{M_1}\right)$$

- Provides a first estimate of the maximum deflection angle for which regular reflection persists before transitioning to Mach reflection.

## Area Matching for Fan Networks
**Mass conservation across a fan segment:**

$$\rho_1 V_1 A_1 = \rho_2 V_2 A_2$$

- Ensures that density \(\rho\), velocity \(V\), and area \(A\) adjustments across combined shock and expansion features still satisfy continuity.
