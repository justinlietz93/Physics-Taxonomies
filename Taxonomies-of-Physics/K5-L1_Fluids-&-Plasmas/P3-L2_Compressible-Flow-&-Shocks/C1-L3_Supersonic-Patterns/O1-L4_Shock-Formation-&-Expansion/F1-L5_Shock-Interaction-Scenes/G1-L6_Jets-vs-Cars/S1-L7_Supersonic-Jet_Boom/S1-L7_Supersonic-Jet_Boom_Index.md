# S1-L7_Supersonic-Jet_Boom — Species Index
**Definition:** The delayed thunder that rolls over neighborhoods when a supersonic aircraft’s shock front sweeps past.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Describe how shock waves form a cone trailing the jet and reach listeners together as a sudden boom.
- Connect the pressure jump to expansion fans that follow, showing why the sound has a double “boom” signature.
