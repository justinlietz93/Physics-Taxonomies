# O1 Shock Formation & Expansion — Book Suggestions

These references cover the physics of shocks and isentropic fans that sculpt supersonic flowfields.

## Core Compressible Flow Texts
- *Modern Compressible Flow* — John D. Anderson. Introduces normal and oblique shock relations, expansion fans, and area–Mach coupling.
- *Elements of Gasdynamics* — Liepmann & Roshko. Provides classic derivations and graphical tools for shock–expansion analysis.

## Applied Aerodynamics and Nozzle Design
- *Aerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion* — Gordon C. Oates. Connects shock/expansion theory with nozzle and turbine blade passages.
- *High-Speed Flight Propulsion Systems* — S. Heiser & D. Pratt. Discusses supersonic inlets and isolators, emphasizing shock control in propulsion contexts.

## Diagnostic and Visualization Resources
- *Schlieren and Shadowgraph Techniques* — G.S. Settles. Details optical methods for observing shock formation and expansion structures.
- *Gasdynamics* — James E.A. John & Theo G. Keith. Offers worked examples and tables for rapid evaluation of shock and fan properties.
