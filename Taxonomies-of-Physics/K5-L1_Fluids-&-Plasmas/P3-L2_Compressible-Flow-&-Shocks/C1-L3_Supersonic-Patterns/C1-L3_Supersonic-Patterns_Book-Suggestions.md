# C1 Supersonic Patterns — Book Suggestions

Supersonic flows generate Mach cones, expansion fans, and pressure signatures. These references develop the kinematics and diagnostics of high-speed patterns.

## Fundamentals of Compressible Flow
- *Modern Compressible Flow* — John D. Anderson Jr. Covers Mach waves, Prandtl–Meyer expansions, and shock interactions.
- *Gas Dynamics* — James E.A. John & Theodore G. Keith. Provides derivations and example problems on Mach number effects and flow regimes.

## Visualization & Measurement
- *High-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing* — Alan Pope & Kenneth Goin. Details schlieren, shadowgraph, and pressure measurement techniques for supersonic patterns.
- *Optical Diagnostics for Flow Characterization* — D. Settles & R. Hargather. Reviews modern imaging and laser-based diagnostics for shock and expansion structures.

## Applications
- *Hypersonic and High-Temperature Gas Dynamics* — John D. Anderson Jr. Extends supersonic concepts to hypersonic regimes relevant to reentry vehicles.
- *Supersonic Aerodynamics: Theoretical and Experimental* — Sverre J. Larsen. Discusses aircraft design features shaped by supersonic pattern control.
