# K5–L1 Fluids & Plasmas
**Definition:** Flowing matter that reshapes to fill space, from water and air currents to ionized gases tied to magnetic fields.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phyla (L2) — index
- P1-L2_Incompressible-Hydrodynamics — smooth vs swirling flows where density barely budges.
- P2-L2_Boundary-Layers-&-Instabilities — thin surface regions that trigger peel-off and flutter.
- P3-L2_Compressible-Flow-&-Shocks — pressure waves and sudden jumps when speeds near sound.
- P4-L2_Free-Surface-&-Multiphase — interfaces, bubbles, and droplets dancing between phases.
- P5-L2_Geophysical-&-Astro-Fluids — rotating, stratified giants shaping weather and disks.
- P6-L2_Magnetohydrodynamics-&-Plasmas — charged flows braided with magnetic fields.

## Native questions
- How do pressure, velocity, and density conspire to steer flowing matter?
- When does a gentle stream tip into turbulence, and can we predict the chaos?
- How do rotation, layering, or magnetic fields set the stage for large-scale patterns?

## Everyday anchors
- Kitchen faucets thinning into sprays, shower steam mixing with cooler air, and airplane wings balancing lift.
- Weather maps tracing jet streams and cyclones across the globe.
- Neon signs, plasma globes, and auroras revealing charged flows in action.
