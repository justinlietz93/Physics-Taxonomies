# K5 Fluids & Plasmas — Book Suggestions

These texts span hydrodynamics, multiphase flows, and plasma physics, giving a shared foundation before the L2 branches dive into specialized regimes.

## Fluid Fundamentals
- *Fluid Mechanics* — Pijush K. Kundu, Ira M. Cohen & David R. Dowling. Comprehensive derivations of the continuity and Navier–Stokes equations with modern examples.
- *An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics* — G.K. Batchelor. Classic treatment emphasizing scaling, vorticity, and boundary layers that connect to instability and turbulence themes.

## Applied & Geophysical Perspectives
- *Intermediate Fluid Mechanics* — James A. Fay. Blends analytical and conceptual explanations of viscous, compressible, and rotating flows relevant to engineering and geophysics.
- *Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate Dynamics* — John Marshall & R. Alan Plumb. Shows how conservation laws play out in stratified and rotating contexts, anchoring the geophysical branch.

## Plasmas & Magnetofluids
- *Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion* — Francis F. Chen. Establishes plasma kinetics, waves, and magnetohydrodynamics as the baseline for the plasma phylum.
- *Principles of Magnetohydrodynamics* — Hans Goedbloed, Stefaan Poedts & Rony Keppens. Connects fluid equations with electromagnetic fields, spanning laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.
