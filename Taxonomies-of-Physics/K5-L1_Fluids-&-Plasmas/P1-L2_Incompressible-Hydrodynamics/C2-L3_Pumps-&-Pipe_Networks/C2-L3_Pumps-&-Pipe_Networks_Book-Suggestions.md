# C2 Pumps & Pipe Networks — Book Suggestions

Pipes and pumps distribute incompressible fluids through engineered systems. These references tackle head loss, pump selection, and network analysis.

## Fluid System Design
- *Fluid Mechanics with Engineering Applications* — E. John Finnemore & Joseph B. Franzini. Provides practical guidance on pipe sizing, pumps, and energy grade lines.
- *Applied Fluid Mechanics* — Robert L. Mott & Joseph A. Untener. Covers pump performance curves, cavitation, and pipeline systems with worked examples.

## Network Modeling
- *Hydraulic Circuit Design and Analysis* — Chris R. McCauley. Explains loop equations, node balance, and iterative solvers for complex networks.
- *Water-Resources Engineering* — Larry W. Mays. Includes municipal water distribution modeling and pump scheduling.

## Operation & Diagnostics
- *Pump Handbook* — Igor J. Karassik et al. Comprehensive reference on pump types, performance corrections, and troubleshooting.
- *Pipeline Design and Construction* — Mo Mohitpour et al. Discusses transient analysis, surge mitigation, and integrity management.
