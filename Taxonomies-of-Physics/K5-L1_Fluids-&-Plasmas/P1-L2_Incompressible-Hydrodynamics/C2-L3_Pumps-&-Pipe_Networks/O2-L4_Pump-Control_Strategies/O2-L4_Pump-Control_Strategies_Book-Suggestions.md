# O2 Pump Control Strategies — Book Suggestions

These books integrate hydraulic principles with automation tactics to help operators tune pump systems for efficiency and stability.

## Fundamentals of Pump Operation
- *Centrifugal Pumps* — Johann F. Gülich. Explains pump performance maps, affinity laws, and how speed adjustments reshape head–flow behavior.
- *Hydraulic Institute Engineering Data Book* — Hydraulic Institute. Provides standard definitions for control valves, NPSH, and energy grade line calculations used in system control.

## Automation and Control Integration
- *Process Dynamics and Control* — Seborg, Edgar, Mellichamp & Doyle. Demonstrates PI/PID configuration and tuning on flow and pressure loops common in pump stations.
- *Practical Process Control for Engineers and Technicians* — Wolfgang Altmann. Offers field-oriented guidance for implementing VFDs, pressure setpoints, and cavitation alarms.

## Energy Optimization References
- *Improving Pumping System Performance* — U.S. Department of Energy. Presents methodologies for matching pump curves to system curves, including case studies on throttling versus variable speed.
- *Energy Efficiency in Pumping Systems* — Viktor Scherer et al. Collects best practices for minimizing lifecycle cost through monitoring, control sequencing, and retrofits.
