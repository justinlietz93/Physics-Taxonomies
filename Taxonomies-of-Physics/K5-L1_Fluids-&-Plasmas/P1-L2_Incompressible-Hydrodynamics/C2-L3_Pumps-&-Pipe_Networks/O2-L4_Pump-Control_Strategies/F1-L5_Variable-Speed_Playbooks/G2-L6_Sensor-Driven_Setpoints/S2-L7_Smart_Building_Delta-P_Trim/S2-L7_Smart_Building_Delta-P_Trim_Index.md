# S2-L7_Smart_Building_Delta-P_Trim — Species Index
**Definition:** Using wireless pressure sensors to nudge pump speed so multi-story buildings stay in their comfort band.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Highlight how remote sensors near top floors feed cloud controls that gently tweak pump speed.
- Connect responsive delta-P control to occupant comfort and quieter pipes compared with constant-speed systems.
