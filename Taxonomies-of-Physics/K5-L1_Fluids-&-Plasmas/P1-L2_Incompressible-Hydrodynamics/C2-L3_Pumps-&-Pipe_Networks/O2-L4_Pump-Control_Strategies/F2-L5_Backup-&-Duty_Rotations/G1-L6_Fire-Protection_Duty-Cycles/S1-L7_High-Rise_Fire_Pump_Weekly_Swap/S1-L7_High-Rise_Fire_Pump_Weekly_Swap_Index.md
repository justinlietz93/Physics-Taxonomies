# S1-L7_High-Rise_Fire_Pump_Weekly_Swap — Species Index
**Definition:** Rotating diesel and electric fire pumps each week so seals stay wet and engines stay ready.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Emphasize logging runtime so the standby pump proves it can meet curve and pass code inspections.
- Mention relief valves and check valves that protect the loop when the alternate pump starts unexpectedly.
