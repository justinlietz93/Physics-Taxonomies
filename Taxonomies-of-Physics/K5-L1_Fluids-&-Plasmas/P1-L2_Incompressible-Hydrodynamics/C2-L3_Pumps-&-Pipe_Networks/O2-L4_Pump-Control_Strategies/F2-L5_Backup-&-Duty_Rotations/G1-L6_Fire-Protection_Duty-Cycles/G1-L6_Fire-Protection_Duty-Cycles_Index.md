# G1-L6_Fire-Protection_Duty-Cycles — Genus Index
**Definition:** Lead-lag fire pump routines that guarantee standby units take over instantly when alarms hit.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_High-Rise_Fire_Pump_Weekly_Swap — alternating diesel and electric pumps to keep both battle-ready.
- S2-L7_Distribution_Warehouse_Jockey_Test — proving jockey pumps maintain pressure while main units rest.
