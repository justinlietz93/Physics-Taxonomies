# O1 Pipe-Loop Energy Balances — Book Suggestions

These references help designers translate network schematics into quantitative head accounting and iteration strategies for closed piping loops.

## Core Head-Loss Frameworks
- *Fluid Mechanics Fundamentals and Applications* — Cengel & Cimbala. Presents Bernoulli extensions, Darcy–Weisbach losses, and practical Moody chart usage for common pipe materials.
- *Fox and McDonald's Introduction to Fluid Mechanics* — Pritchard & Leylegian. Walks through conservation equations and applies them to multi-branch piping examples.

## Network Balancing Methods
- *Applied Fluid Mechanics for Engineers* — Mott & Untener. Includes Hardy Cross procedures and contemporary adaptations for computerized loop balancing.
- *Pipeline Rules of Thumb Handbook* — E.W. McAllister. Supplies quick estimates for friction factors, minor-loss coefficients, and pump sizing in industrial grids.

## Pump and System Curve Integration
- *Pump Handbook* — Karassik et al. Details pump performance curves and how to match them with system head requirements for reliable operation.
- *Centrifugal Pump Design and Performance* — Sulzer Pumps. Offers case studies linking pump characteristics, control valves, and loop energy audits.
