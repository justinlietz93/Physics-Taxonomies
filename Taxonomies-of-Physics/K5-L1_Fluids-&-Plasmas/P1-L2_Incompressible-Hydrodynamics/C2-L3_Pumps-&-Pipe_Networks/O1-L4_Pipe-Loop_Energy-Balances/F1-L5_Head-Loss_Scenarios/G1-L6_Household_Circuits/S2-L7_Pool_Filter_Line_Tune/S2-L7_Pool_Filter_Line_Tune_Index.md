# S2-L7_Pool_Filter_Line_Tune — Species Index
**Definition:** Re-routing hoses, valves, and cartridges on a backyard pool loop to hit the target pressure gauge reading.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Show how every hose bend or clogged cartridge is a friction story that subtracts from pump head.
- Tie the pressure gauge sweet spot to ensuring the return jets stay strong without cavitating the pump.
