# G2-L6_Campus-Utility_Rings — Genus Index
**Definition:** Larger distribution loops for chilled water or steam where long pipe runs and fittings tax central pumps.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Chilled-Water_Balance_Walk — trimming circuit setters on a university cooling loop before summer heat.
- S2-L7_Fire-Sprinkler_Flow_Test — flowing hydrants at loop edges to verify pumps can hold required pressure.
