# S2-L7_Fire-Sprinkler_Flow_Test — Species Index
**Definition:** Running hydrant and standpipe flows to confirm building sprinkler loops hold code-required pressure at demand points.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Explain how measuring pitot pressures at remote hydrants proves the pump can overcome all loop friction.
- Link the test curves to the energy grade line falling from pump discharge to the farthest sprinkler head.
