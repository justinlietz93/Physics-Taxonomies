## Turbulence Fundamentals
- *Turbulence: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers* — P.A. Davidson. Covers turbulence statistics, Kolmogorov scales, and energy cascades.
- *Turbulent Flows* — Stephen B. Pope. Comprehensive treatment of turbulent kinetic energy budgets and closure models.

## Engineering Correlations
