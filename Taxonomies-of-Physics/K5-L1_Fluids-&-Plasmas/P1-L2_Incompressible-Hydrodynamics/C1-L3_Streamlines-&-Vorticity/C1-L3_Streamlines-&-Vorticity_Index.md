# C1-L3_Streamlines-&-Vorticity — Class Index
**Definition:** Tools for sketching where fluid parcels travel and how spinning cores stretch, fold, and mix them.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Order (L4) — index
- O1-L4_Laminar-vs-Turbulent-Flow-Regimes — contrasts between orderly layers and chaotic swirls.
- O2-L4_Vorticity-Transport_Playbooks — tracking how vortices are born, shed, and diffused.
