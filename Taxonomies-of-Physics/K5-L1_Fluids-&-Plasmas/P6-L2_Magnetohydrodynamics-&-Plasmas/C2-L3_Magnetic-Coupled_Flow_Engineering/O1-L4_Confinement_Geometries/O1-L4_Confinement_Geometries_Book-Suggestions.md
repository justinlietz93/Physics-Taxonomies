# O1 Confinement Geometries — Book Suggestions

These texts survey magnetic confinement configurations and the equilibrium metrics that describe them.

## Tokamaks and Stellarators
- *Principles of Fusion Energy* — A.A. Harms et al. Covers Grad–Shafranov equilibria, safety factors, and beta limits.
- *Stellarator and Heliotron Devices* — Masayoshi Wakatani. Details field line geometry and confinement optimization in non-axisymmetric systems.

## Mirror and Open Systems
- *Mirror-Based Fusion* — Kenneth Fowler. Discusses mirror ratios, cusp configurations, and end loss mitigation.
- *Magnetic Confinement Fusion* — Jeff Freidberg. Provides comprehensive treatment of magnetic mirror concepts alongside tokamak theory.

## Performance Metrics
