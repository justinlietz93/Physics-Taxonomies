# O1 Frozen-in Field Dynamics — Book Suggestions

These references emphasize flux-freezing, magnetic Reynolds number scaling, and conditions that break ideal MHD behavior.

## Ideal MHD Treatments
- *Magnetohydrodynamics* — Thomas J. Hughes. Develops flux-freezing theorems and Lie derivatives in ideal plasmas.
- *Fundamentals of Magnetohydrodynamics* — P. A. Davidson. Explains magnetic Reynolds number, induction effects, and field advection.

## Non-Ideal and Hall Effects
- *Physics of Space Plasmas* — Cowley, Priest & Fritz. Discusses Hall MHD, generalized Ohm’s law, and reconnection onset.
- *Magnetic Reconnection: Concepts and Applications* — Walter Gonzalez & Bruce Parker. Details Sweet–Parker scaling and fast reconnection regimes.

## Numerical and Experimental Perspectives
- *Principles of Magnetospheric Dynamics* — J.A. Slavin & R.E. Lopez. Applies flux-freezing diagnostics to space observations.
- *Handbook of Plasma Physics, Volume 1* — M.N. Rosenbluth & R.Z. Sagdeev (eds.). Provides experimental and computational views on frozen-in breakdowns.
