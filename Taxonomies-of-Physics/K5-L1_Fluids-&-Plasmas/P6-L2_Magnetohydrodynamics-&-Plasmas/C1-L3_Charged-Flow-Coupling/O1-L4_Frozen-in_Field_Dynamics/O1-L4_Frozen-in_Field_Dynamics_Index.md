# O1-L4_Frozen-in_Field_Dynamics — Order Index
**Definition:** Detail ideal MHD assumptions that tie fluid motion to magnetic field transport.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Alfvénic_Flow_Examples** — field-aligned perturbations and waves in strongly magnetized plasmas.
- **F2-L5_Flux-Freezing_Breakdowns** — reconnection and resistive effects that let lines slip.
