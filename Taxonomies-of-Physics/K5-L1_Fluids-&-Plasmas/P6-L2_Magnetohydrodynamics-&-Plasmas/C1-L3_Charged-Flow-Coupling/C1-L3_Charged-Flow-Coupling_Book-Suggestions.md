# C1 Charged Flow Coupling — Book Suggestions

Magnetized plasmas couple electromagnetic fields with fluid motion. These references establish magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) basics and plasma responses to fields.

## MHD Foundations
- *Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion* — Francis F. Chen. Covers single-fluid MHD equations, waves, and basic instabilities.
- *Principles of Magnetohydrodynamics* — J.P. Freidberg. Provides rigorous derivations of ideal and resistive MHD.

## Waves & Instabilities
- *Waves and Instabilities in Plasmas* — A.B. Mikhailovskii. Explores Alfvén waves, magnetosonic modes, and coupled instabilities.
- *Plasma Physics via Computer Simulation* — C.K. Birdsall & A.B. Langdon. Introduces numerical experiments for charged flow coupling.

## Applications
- *Space Plasma Physics* — May-Britt Kallenrode. Connects MHD concepts to solar wind, magnetospheres, and cosmic plasmas.
- *Magnetohydrodynamics: Historical Evolution and Trends* — S. Molokov, R. Moreau & H.K. Moffatt (eds.). Discusses metallurgical and astrophysical MHD flows.
