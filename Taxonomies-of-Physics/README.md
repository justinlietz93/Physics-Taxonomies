# Physics as Taxonomies

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

- K1. [Mechanics](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K1-L1_Mechanics)
  - Motions, forces, and energy trades for objects from single particles to complex machines. We watch who pushes, how resistance answers, and where “downhill” sits in the energy landscape.
- K2. [Heat, Chance, & Entropy](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K2-L1_Heat-Chance-&-Entropy)
  - How energy spreads, random fluctuations emerge, and order reshapes when many particles jostle and trade energy. 
- K3. [Waves & Fields](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K3-L1_Waves-&-Fields)
  - Explains how disturbances travel, interact, and carry energy or information through space and media.
- K4. [Matter & Materials](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K4-L1_Matter-&-Materials)
  - Explores how atoms arrange into solids, liquids, and beyond, and how those patterns shape everyday material behavior.
- K5. [Fluids & Plasmas](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K5-L1_Fluids-&-Plasmas)
  - Flowing matter that reshapes to fill space, from water and air currents to ionized gases tied to magnetic fields.
- K6. [Electromagnetism & Light](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K6-L1_Electromagnetism-&-Light)
  - How electric charges, currents, and light share energy and information through space in everyday tech and nature.
- K7. [Quantum & Quanta](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K7-L1_Quantum-&-Quanta)
  - The staircase world where energy, momentum, and information come in discrete packets that reshape how matter behaves.
- K8. [Gravity, Spacetime, & Cosmos](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K8-L1_Gravity-Spacetime-&-Cosmos)
  - Gravity tells matter how to move and matter tells spacetime how to curve; this kingdom tracks how cosmic structure, motion, and measurement arise from that interplay.
- K9. [Measurement, Signals, & Control](/Taxonomies-of-Physics/K9-L1_Measurement-Signals-&-Control)
  - Tools, models, and feedback loops that let us sense the world, clean up information, and steer systems gently toward targets.
