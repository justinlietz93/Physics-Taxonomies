# G1 Collapse Record Checklists — Book Suggestions

Keeping accurate collapse ledgers demands a mix of measurement theory, laboratory workflow, and data hygiene. These titles help teams translate the abstract projection postulate into reliable logbook routines.

## Measurement Theory Foundations
- *Quantum Measurement* — Vladimir B. Braginsky & Farid Ya. Khalili. Explains projective updates, back-action, and detector response so lab notes mirror the underlying math.
- *Quantum Measurement Theory and its Applications* — Howard M. Wiseman & Gerard J. Milburn. Connects density-matrix evolution and conditional states to practical record keeping.

## Laboratory Logging Practices
- *Experimental Methods in Quantum Optics* — Rainer Blatt & Paul Zoller. Shares workflow patterns for documenting outcomes, normalization steps, and error estimates in optics labs.
- *Superconducting Qubits: A Practical Approach* — Serge Rosenblum & Hakan E. Türeci. Highlights shot-by-shot logging conventions used in circuit QED experiments.

## Data Integrity and Checklist Automation
- *Data Management for Researchers* — Kristin Briney. Offers reproducible logging templates, metadata standards, and audit strategies adaptable to collapse records.
- *Practical Data Analysis with Jupyter* — Philipp Kats. Demonstrates notebook-driven validation checks that echo the probability and fidelity calculations in each entry.
