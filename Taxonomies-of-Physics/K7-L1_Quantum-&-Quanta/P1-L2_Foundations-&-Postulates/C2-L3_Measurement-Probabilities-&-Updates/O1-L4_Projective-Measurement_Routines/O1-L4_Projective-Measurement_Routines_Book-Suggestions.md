# O1 Projective-Measurement Routines — Book Suggestions

These books clarify how the Born rule, projectors, and collapse postulates organize ideal quantum measurements.

## Core Treatments
- *Quantum Measurement* — Vladimir B. Braginsky & Farid Ya. Khalili. Systematic exploration of projective measurements, back-action, and standard quantum limits.
- *Quantum Measurement Theory and its Applications* — Howard M. Wiseman & Gerard J. Milburn. Connects projection postulates with continuous monitoring and feedback frameworks.

## Mathematical Perspectives
- *Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods* — Asher Peres. Deep discussion of projective measurements, commuting observables, and state update rules.
- *Lectures on Quantum Mechanics* — Steven Weinberg. Provides postulate-level analysis of measurements, degeneracy handling, and density-matrix updates.

## Experimental & Practical Guides
- *Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers* — David A.B. Miller. Intuitive presentation of measurement probabilities with laboratory-focused examples.
- *Principles of Quantum Mechanics* — R. Shankar. Worked problems on projection operators, sequential measurements, and expectation values.
