# G1 Stern-Gerlach Workflows — Book Suggestions

Stern–Gerlach stations demand a balance of quantum measurement theory, magnetic hardware know-how, and diagnostic imaging. These resources help teams tune gradients, align beams, and interpret spin-resolved detector patterns.

## Spin Measurement Foundations
- *Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications* — Nouredine Zettili. Provides thorough treatments of angular momentum, projection operators, and Stern–Gerlach examples that underpin every checklist step.
- *Modern Quantum Mechanics* — J. J. Sakurai & Jim Napolitano. Offers compact derivations of spinor evolution and measurement that translate directly into the equations technicians log.

## Experimental Setups and Magnet Design
- *Atomic Physics* — Christopher Foot. Details beam sources, state preparation, and Stern–Gerlach hardware geometries for alkali atoms.
- *Magnet Design: Theory and Practice* — Brigette Bienias & Marcel Reiser. Explains gradient coil construction, magnetic materials, and calibration techniques used to hit target separations.

## Detection and Imaging Tactics
- *Techniques of Vacuum Ultraviolet Spectroscopy* — George Sampson. Covers detector alignment, phosphor screens, and imaging electronics suitable for atomic beam readouts.
- *Handbook of Laser Technology and Applications* — Colin E. Webb & Julian D. C. Jones. Supplies beam-collimation and optical pumping insights that improve analyzer fidelity.
