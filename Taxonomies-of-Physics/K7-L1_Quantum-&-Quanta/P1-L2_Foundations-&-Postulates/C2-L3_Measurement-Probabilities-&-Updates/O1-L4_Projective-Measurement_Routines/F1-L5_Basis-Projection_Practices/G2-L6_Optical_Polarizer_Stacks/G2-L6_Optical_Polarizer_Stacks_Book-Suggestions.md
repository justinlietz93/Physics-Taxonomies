# G2 Optical Polarizer Stacks — Book Suggestions

Photon projection stations rely on optical design texts that connect Jones calculus, coatings, and detector readouts. These picks help teams engineer multi-element polarizer assemblies with predictable measurement statistics.

## Polarization Theory and Modeling
- *Polarized Light, Third Edition* — Dennis Goldstein. Offers deep coverage of Stokes parameters, Jones calculus, and system modeling for cascaded elements.
- *Principles of Optics* — Max Born & Emil Wolf. Provides rigorous treatments of polarization transformations and coherence needed to validate stack equations.

## Optical Component Engineering
- *Applied Photographic Optics* — Sidney Ray. Discusses coatings, birefringent materials, and assembly tolerances relevant to high-extinction polarizers.
- *Handbook of Optics, Volume I* — Optical Society of America. Supplies datasheets and design tables for polarizers, waveplates, and beam splitters used in stack construction.

## Instrumentation and Calibration
- *Building Electro-Optical Systems* — Ronald S. Krug. Covers alignment, detector calibration, and noise budgeting for optical measurement benches.
- *Practical Guide to Optical Alignment* — Alson E. Hatheway. Shares alignment workflows and metrology methods that keep stack channels balanced.
