# C2 Measurement Probabilities & Updates — Book Suggestions

Measurement postulates connect quantum amplitudes to probabilities and state collapse. These texts explore POVMs, decoherence, and quantum Bayesian updates.

## Measurement Theory
- *Quantum Measurement* — Vladimir Braginsky & Farid Khalili. Introduces projective measurements, back-action, and continuous observation.
- *Quantum Measurement Theory and its Applications* — Howard M. Wiseman & Gerard J. Milburn. Covers POVMs, Kraus operators, and quantum trajectories.

## Foundations & Interpretations
- *Decoherence and the Appearance of a Classical World in Quantum Theory* — Maximilian Schlosshauer. Explains how measurement outcomes emerge via decoherence.
- *Quantum Bayesianism: An Introduction* — Christopher A. Fuchs & Rüdiger Schack. Discusses probability assignments and updates.

## Applications
- *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* — Nielsen & Chuang. Provides measurement-based algorithms and error correction.
- *Quantum State Estimation* — Massar & Paris (eds.). Focuses on tomography, estimation, and adaptive measurement updates.
