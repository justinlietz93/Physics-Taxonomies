- *Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications* — Nouredine Zettili. Step-by-step development of state vectors, inner products, and completeness relations with solved problems.

## Mathematical Supplements
- *Linear Algebra and Quantum Mechanics* — David H. McIntyre. Focused bridge between linear algebra concepts and quantum state construction.
- *Quantum Theory for Mathematicians* — Brian C. Hall. Rigorous Hilbert space treatment with emphasis on functional analysis aspects of quantum states.

## Problem Collections
- *Problems and Solutions in Quantum Mechanics* — Kyriakos Tamvakis. Exercises on normalization, orthogonality, and basis changes.
- *Schaum's Outline of Quantum Mechanics* — Zahid H. Chowdhury. Concise worked examples for projections, operator action, and state expansions.
