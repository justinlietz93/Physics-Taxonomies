# G1-L6_Rotation-vs_Spin_Commutators — Genus Index
**Definition:** Side-by-side labs that show how spatial and spin rotations obey the same algebra.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Spin-Half_Pauli_Cycle_Lab — cycle through Pauli operators with a benchtop spin qubit trainer.
- S2-L7_Light_Paddle_Commutator_Demo — use polarization paddles to feel non-commuting rotations on light.
