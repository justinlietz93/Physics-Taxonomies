# C1 State Postulates & Wavefunctions — Book Suggestions

Quantum mechanics begins with postulates about states, observables, and evolution. These resources clarify Hilbert spaces, bra–ket notation, and physical interpretation.

## Core Texts
- *Principles of Quantum Mechanics* — R. Shankar. Thorough derivation of postulates, state vectors, and operator algebra.
- *Modern Quantum Mechanics* — J.J. Sakurai & Jim Napolitano. Emphasizes symmetry, states, and Dirac notation.

## Conceptual Guides
- *Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals* — Richard P. Feynman & Albert R. Hibbs. Offers alternative perspectives on state evolution.
- *Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods* — Asher Peres. Discusses interpretation, state vectors, and operational postulates.

## Mathematical Foundations
- *Mathematics for Quantum Mechanics* — John David Jackson. Provides Hilbert-space theorems and spectral decompositions.
- *Functional Analysis* — Walter Rudin. Supplies rigorous background on operators and inner-product spaces.
