# K7 Quantum & Quanta — Book Suggestions

Quantum theory requires a blend of conceptual clarity and mathematical rigor. These selections keep the scope broad so the L2 branches—foundations, bound states, many-body, and beyond—can specialize from a common base.

## Foundational Expositions
- *Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum* — Leonard Susskind & Art Friedman. Strips the subject to core postulates, operators, and simple systems with emphasis on problem solving.
- *Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals* — Richard P. Feynman & Albert R. Hibbs. Introduces the path integral viewpoint that supports scattering, field theory, and statistical extensions.

## Comprehensive Texts
- *Principles of Quantum Mechanics* — R. Shankar. Systematic development of formalism, symmetries, and perturbation theory with extensive exercises.
- *Modern Quantum Mechanics* — J.J. Sakurai & Jim Napolitano. Highlights symmetry methods, angular momentum, and measurement theory relevant to all phyla.

## Interpretive & Applied Bridges
- *Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications* — Nouredine Zettili. Bridges theory with worked examples across atoms, oscillators, and angular momentum.
- *Quantum Information Science* — Michel A. Nielsen & Isaac L. Chuang. Extends the postulates to qubits and entanglement, previewing species focused on information processing.
