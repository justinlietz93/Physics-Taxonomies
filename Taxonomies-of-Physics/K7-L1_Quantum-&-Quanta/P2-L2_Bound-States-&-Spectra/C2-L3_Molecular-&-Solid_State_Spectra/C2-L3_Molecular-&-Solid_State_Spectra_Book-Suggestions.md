# C2 Molecular & Solid State Spectra — Book Suggestions

Molecular vibrations and solid-state bands produce rich spectra. These references connect quantum structure to infrared, Raman, and electronic spectra.

## Molecular Spectroscopy
- *Molecular Quantum Mechanics* — Peter Atkins & Ronald Friedman. Covers rotational, vibrational, and electronic transitions.
- *Fundamentals of Molecular Spectroscopy* — C.N. Banwell & E.M. McCash. Provides practical spectroscopy tools and selection rules.

## Solid-State Spectroscopy
- *Optical Properties of Solids* — Mark Fox. Describes excitons, phonons, and band-to-band transitions.
- *Solid State Physics* — Ashcroft & Mermin. Introduces band theory and density of states relevant to optical spectra.

## Experimental Techniques
- *Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy* — Peter Larkin. Emphasizes vibrational spectra acquisition and interpretation.
- *Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy* — Andrea Damascelli. Reviews ARPES techniques for probing electronic band structures.
