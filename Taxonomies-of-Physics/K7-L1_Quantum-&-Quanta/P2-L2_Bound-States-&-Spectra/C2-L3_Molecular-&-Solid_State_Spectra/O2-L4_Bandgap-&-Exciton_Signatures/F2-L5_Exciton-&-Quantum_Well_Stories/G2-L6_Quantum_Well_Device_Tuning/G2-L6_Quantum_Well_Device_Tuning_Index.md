# G2-L6_Quantum_Well_Device_Tuning — Genus Index
**Definition:** Engineering playbooks for tailoring quantum wells in lasers, detectors, and modulators.
## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Species (L7) — everyday exemplars
- S1-L7_Fiber_Laser_Quantum_Well_Tune — telecom labs tune wells for specific wavelengths.
- S2-L7_IR_Detector_Well_Stack_Optimization — aerospace teams optimize multi-quantum wells for IR sensing.
