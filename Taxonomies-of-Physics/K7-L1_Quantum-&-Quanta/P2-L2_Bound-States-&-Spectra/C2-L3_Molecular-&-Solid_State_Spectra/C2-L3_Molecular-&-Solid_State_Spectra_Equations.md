# C2 Molecular & Solid State Spectra — Core Equations

Molecular spectra depend on quantized rotational and vibrational levels, while solids exhibit band structures and density-of-states features. These equations summarize key relations.

## Molecular Energy Levels
**Rigid rotor energies:**

$$E_{J} = \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2I} J(J+1)$$

- Rotational energy levels for moment of inertia $I$ and quantum number $J$, producing equally spaced microwave spectra.

**Harmonic oscillator energies:**

$$E_{v} = \hbar \omega_{0} \left(v + \tfrac{1}{2}\right)$$

- Vibrational levels with frequency $\omega_{0}$ and quantum number $v$, governing infrared absorption peaks.

## Solid-State Transitions
**Joint density of states:**

$$J(E) = \int D_{c}(E + \hbar \omega) D_{v}(E) dE$$

- Convolves conduction and valence density-of-states functions $D_{c}$ and $D_{v}$ to predict interband absorption strength.

**Absorption coefficient (direct gap):**

$$\alpha(\hbar \omega) \propto \frac{1}{\hbar \omega} (\hbar \omega - E_{g})^{1/2}$$

- Near a direct band gap $E_{g}$, absorption scales with the square root of excess photon energy.

## Selection Rules & Intensities
**Rotational selection rule:**

$$\Delta J = \pm 1$$

- Electric dipole transitions in diatomic molecules require $J$ to change by ±1, creating P and R branches.

**Raman shift relation:**

$$\Delta \nu = \nu_{0} - \nu_{s}$$

- Raman spectra report the frequency difference between incident light $\nu_{0}$ and scattered light $\nu_{s}$, corresponding to vibrational energies.
