# C1 Atomic & Ionic Spectra — Book Suggestions

Atomic spectra reveal discrete energy levels and selection rules. These references cover hydrogenic models, fine structure, and spectroscopic techniques.

## Foundational Texts
- *Introduction to Atomic Spectra* — Harvey Elliott White. Classic text on term symbols, energy levels, and transitions.
- *Atomic Physics* — Christopher J. Foot. Modern treatment of atomic structure and spectroscopy with emphasis on experiments.

## Advanced Topics
- *The Theory of Atomic Structure and Spectra* — Robert D. Cowan. Provides computational methods for multi-electron atoms and ions.
- *Laser Spectroscopy* — Wolfgang Demtröder. Explains high-resolution techniques for measuring atomic transitions.

## Data & Applications
- *NIST Atomic Spectra Database* — Reader & Kramida. Authoritative data source for line positions and oscillator strengths.
- *Plasma Diagnostic Techniques* — R.H. Huddlestone & S.L. Leonard. Uses atomic spectra to infer plasma parameters.
