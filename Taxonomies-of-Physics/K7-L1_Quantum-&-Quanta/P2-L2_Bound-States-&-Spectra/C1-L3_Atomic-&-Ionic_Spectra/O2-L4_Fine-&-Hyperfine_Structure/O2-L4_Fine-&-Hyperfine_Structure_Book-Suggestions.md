# O2 Fine & Hyperfine Structure — Book Suggestions

These titles examine relativistic and nuclear corrections that split atomic energy levels.

## Fine Structure Foundations
- *Relativistic Quantum Mechanics* — James D. Bjorken & Sidney D. Drell. Derives spin-orbit coupling, Darwin terms, and relativistic corrections for hydrogen-like atoms.
- *Quantum Mechanics, Volume 2* — Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Bernard Diu & Franck Laloë. Detailed exposition of fine-structure perturbation theory and Lamb shift origins.

## Hyperfine and Nuclear Effects
- *Atomic Physics* — Christopher J. Foot. Accessible discussion of hyperfine splitting, Zeeman effects, and spectroscopy of alkali atoms.
- *The Physics of Atoms and Quanta* — Hermann Haken & Hans C. Wolf. Covers hyperfine interactions, isotope shifts, and experimental methods.

## Precision Spectroscopy
- *Precision Laser Spectroscopy* — Ernst O. Goebel & Uwe Siegner. Highlights measurement techniques resolving fine and hyperfine splittings.
- *Quantum Optics* — Marlan O. Scully & M. Suhail Zubairy. Connects fine-structure details to coherent control, selection rules, and quantum optics experiments.
