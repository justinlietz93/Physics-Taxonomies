# O1 Line-Series Diagnostics — Book Suggestions

These texts explain atomic line series, selection rules, and diagnostic spectroscopy techniques.

## Atomic Structure Foundations
- *Introduction to Atomic Spectra* — Harvey Elliott White. Classic derivation of Rydberg formulas, selection rules, and series limits.
- *The Theory of Atomic Structure and Spectra* — Robert D. Cowan. Comprehensive treatment of atomic energy levels, angular momentum coupling, and spectral calculations.

## Spectroscopic Techniques
- *Atomic Spectra and Radiative Transitions* — I.I. Sobelman. Focused on transition probabilities, line strengths, and broadening mechanisms.
- *Principles of Laser Spectroscopy and Quantum Optics* — Paul R. Berman & Vladimir S. Malinovsky. Modern instrumentation perspectives on measuring line series.

## Diagnostic Applications
- *Plasma Spectroscopy* — Takashi Fujimoto. Applies line series diagnostics to temperature and density measurements in plasmas.
- *Astronomical Spectroscopy* — Jonathan Tennyson. Uses stellar and nebular line series to infer astrophysical conditions.
