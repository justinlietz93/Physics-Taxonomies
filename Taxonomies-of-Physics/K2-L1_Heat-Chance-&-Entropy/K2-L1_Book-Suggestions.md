# K2 Heat, Chance & Entropy — Book Suggestions

Thermal physics links macroscopic flows of heat with microscopic counting. These broad texts frame the thermodynamic, statistical, and fluctuation viewpoints that later levels specialize.

## Thermodynamic Foundations
- *An Introduction to Thermal Physics* — Daniel V. Schroeder. Friendly exposition of the first and second laws, engines, and entropy, with problems that map directly to the thermodynamics and transport phyla.
- *Thermodynamics* — Enrico Fermi. Concise, axiomatic treatment of equilibrium thermodynamics that grounds the overarching lenses of symmetry and energy conservation.

## Statistical Mechanics Bridges
- *Statistical Physics* — Landau & Lifshitz (Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 5). Develops ensembles, fluctuations, and phase transitions in a way that seeds all downstream branches.
- *Equilibrium Statistical Physics* — Michael Plischke & Birger Bergersen. Connects partition functions to response theory, bridging microscopic probability with macroscopic observables.

## Entropy & Information Perspectives
- *Entropy and Information Theory* — Robert M. Gray. Reinterprets entropy and free energy through information-theoretic language, reinforcing the randomness and inference aspects of this kingdom.
- *The Second Law* — P.W. Atkins. Narrative account of irreversibility and the arrow of time that keeps the conceptual scaffolding clear before diving into specialized models.
