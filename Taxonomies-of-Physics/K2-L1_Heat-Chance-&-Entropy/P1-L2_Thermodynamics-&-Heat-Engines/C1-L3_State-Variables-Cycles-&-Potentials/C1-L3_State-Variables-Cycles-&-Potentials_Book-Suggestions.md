# C1 State Variables, Cycles & Potentials — Book Suggestions

Thermodynamic state variables let us chart cycles and potentials without tracking every molecule. These texts ground the language of properties, diagrams, and Legendre transforms used across the class.

## Thermodynamic Foundations
- *Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics* — Herbert B. Callen. Builds the postulate-based framework for state variables, equations of state, and potentials.
- *Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics* — Michael J. Moran, Howard N. Shapiro, Daisie D. Boettner & Margaret B. Bailey. Connects property tables, phase diagrams, and control-mass analyses to engineering cycles.

## Cycle Analysis
- *Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach* — Yunus A. Çengel & Michael A. Boles. Provides worked Rankine, Brayton, and refrigeration cycles with property plotting guidance.
- *Advanced Thermodynamics for Engineers* — Kenneth Wark. Emphasizes generalized coordinates and availability to dissect complex cycle variations.

## Potentials & Transformations
- *Modern Thermodynamics with Statistical Mechanics* — Carl S. Helrich. Links Legendre transforms, free energies, and Maxwell relations to microscopic interpretations.
- *Chemical, Biochemical, and Engineering Thermodynamics* — Stanley I. Sandler. Illustrates Gibbs and Helmholtz potentials in mixtures and reacting systems relevant to process design.
