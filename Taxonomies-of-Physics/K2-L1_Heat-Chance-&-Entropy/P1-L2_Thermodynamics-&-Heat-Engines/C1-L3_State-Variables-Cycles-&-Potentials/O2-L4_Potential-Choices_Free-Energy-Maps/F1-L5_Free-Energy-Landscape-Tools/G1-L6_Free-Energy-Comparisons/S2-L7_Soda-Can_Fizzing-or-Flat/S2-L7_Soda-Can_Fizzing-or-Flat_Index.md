# S2-L7_Soda-Can_Fizzing-or-Flat — Species Index
**Definition:** A sealed soda can stays fizzy until opened, when chemical potentials shift and carbon dioxide escapes.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- In a closed can the dissolved CO₂ and headspace gas share a chemical potential, so bubbles stay in solution.
- Popping the tab drops the pressure, lowering the gas free energy and letting bubbles grow and escape until equilibrium returns.
