# S1-L7_Battery_Pack_Free_Energy_Extension_Log — Species Index
**Definition:** Extension log for plotting lithium pack free-energy adjustments when cooling, charge limits, or chemistries shift.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Log temperature gradients and state-of-charge windows that reshape Gibbs free-energy curves.
- Note module compression or coolant tweaks that move phase stability islands.
- Tie every extension to range, lifetime, or fast-charge promises for customers.
