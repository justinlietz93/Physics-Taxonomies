# S2-L7_Hydrogen_Plant_Potential_Selection_Binder — Species Index
**Definition:** Binder for selecting potentials across electrolyzer, compression, and storage legs in hydrogen facilities.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Align chemical potential treatments in electrolyzers with mechanical work terms in compressors.
- Document thermal management strategies so cold boxes and storage vessels stay within design envelopes.
- Provide quick decision trees to help teams swap potentials when new sensors or markets arrive.
