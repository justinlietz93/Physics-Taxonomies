# O2 Potential Choices & Free-Energy Maps — Book Suggestions

These references help practitioners master when to reach for internal energy, enthalpy, Gibbs, or Helmholtz descriptions and how to read their geometric implications.

## Legendre Transform Foundations
- *Callen's Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics* — Herbert B. Callen. Builds free-energy landscapes from first principles with clear derivations of Maxwell relations.
- *Modern Thermodynamics* — Dilip Kondepudi & Ilya Prigogine. Emphasizes the structural roles of potentials in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium narratives.

## Phase and Chemical Applications
- *Introduction to Modern Thermodynamics* — Gordon J. Van Wylen & Sonntag. Focuses on \(G\) and \(A\) in phase stability, chemical equilibria, and mixture problems relevant to this order.
- *Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics* — Sandler. Offers graphical and computational tools for mapping \(G\) surfaces, azeotropes, and activity models.

## Advanced Free-Energy Mapping
- *Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Molecular Simulation* — Mark Tuckerman. Connects microscopic partition functions to macroscopic potentials and surfaces.
- *Free Energy Calculations: Theory and Applications in Chemistry and Biology* — Chipot & Pohorille. Demonstrates umbrella sampling, thermodynamic integration, and potential of mean force construction that underpin modern free-energy maps.
