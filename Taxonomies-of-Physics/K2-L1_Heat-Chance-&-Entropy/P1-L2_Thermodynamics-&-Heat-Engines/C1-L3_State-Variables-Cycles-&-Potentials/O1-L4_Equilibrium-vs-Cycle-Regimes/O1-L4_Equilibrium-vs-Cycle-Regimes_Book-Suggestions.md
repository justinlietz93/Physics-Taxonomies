# O1 Equilibrium vs Cycle Regimes — Book Suggestions

These titles contrast equilibrium thermodynamics with cyclic engine thinking, giving readers a toolkit for switching between state snapshots and loop analyses.

## Foundational Thermodynamics Texts
- *Thermodynamics* — Enrico Fermi. A concise exposition of equilibrium state functions, exact differentials, and Legendre transforms that anchors the "snapshot" mindset before cycles enter.
- *Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics* — Smith, Van Ness & Abbott. Walks through \(PVT\) relations, residual properties, and free-energy formalisms that clarify why different potentials suit different constraints.

## Cycle-Centered References
- *Thermodynamic Cycles: Analysis and Design* — Chih Wu. Surveys Rankine, Brayton, refrigeration, and regenerative loops with clear entropy-generation accounting.
- *Power Plant Engineering* — P.K. Nag. Bridges textbook thermodynamics with real plant layouts, showing how component maps turn into closed-cycle performance metrics.

## Bridging Equilibrium and Dynamics
- *Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics* — Adrian Bejan. Highlights exergy balances and entropy production, explicitly quantifying departures from the reversible equilibrium baseline.
- *Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics and its Statistical Foundations* — Hans Christian Öttinger. Provides the statistical backing for cycle irreversibility while reinforcing state-function rigor.
