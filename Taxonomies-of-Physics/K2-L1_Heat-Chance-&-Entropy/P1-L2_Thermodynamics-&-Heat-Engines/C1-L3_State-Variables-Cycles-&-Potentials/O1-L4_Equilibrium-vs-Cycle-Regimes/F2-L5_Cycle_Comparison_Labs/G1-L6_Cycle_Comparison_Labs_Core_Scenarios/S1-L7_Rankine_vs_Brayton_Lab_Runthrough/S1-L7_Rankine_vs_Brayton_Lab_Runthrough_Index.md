# S1-L7_Rankine_vs_Brayton_Lab_Runthrough — Species Index
**Definition:** Guided lab comparing steam Rankine and gas Brayton loops using matched heat input to highlight efficiency tradeoffs.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Step students through plotting both cycles on the same T–s chart so compressor vs pump work jumps out visually.
- Measure turbine outlet temperatures to discuss material limits that cap Brayton efficiency gains.
- Close by balancing heat exchanger duties to show why combined cycles blend both architectures.
