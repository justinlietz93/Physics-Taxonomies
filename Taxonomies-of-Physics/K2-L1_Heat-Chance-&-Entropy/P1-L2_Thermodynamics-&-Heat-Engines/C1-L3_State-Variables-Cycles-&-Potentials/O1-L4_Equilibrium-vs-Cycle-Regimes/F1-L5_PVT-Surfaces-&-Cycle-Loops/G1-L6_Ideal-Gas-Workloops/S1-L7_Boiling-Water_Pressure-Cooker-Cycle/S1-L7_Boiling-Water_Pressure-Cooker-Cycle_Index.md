# S1-L7_Boiling-Water_Pressure-Cooker-Cycle — Species Index
**Definition:** A kitchen pressure cooker cycles steam pressure to cook food quickly at elevated temperatures.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Steam generated inside the sealed pot pushes against a weighted valve, raising boiling temperature and pressure.
- Opening and reseating the valve vents bursts of steam, tracing a loop on the pressure–volume plane that shows work exchanged with the environment.
