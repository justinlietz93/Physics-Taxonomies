# P1–L2 Thermodynamics & Heat Engines
**Definition:** Big-picture descriptions of energy, work, and heat as systems move between equilibrium states and cycles.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Class (L3) — index
- **C1-L3_State-Variables-Cycles-&-Potentials** — state descriptions, free energies, and looped energy trades.
- **C2-L3_Irreversibility_Engines-&-Efficiency** — compares real engine layouts with where efficiency is lost or regained.
