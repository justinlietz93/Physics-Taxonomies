# C2 Irreversibility, Engines & Efficiency — Book Suggestions

Real engines leak performance through irreversibilities. These resources highlight entropy production, exergy accounting, and design tactics to approach ideal limits.

## Second-Law Frameworks
- *Advanced Engineering Thermodynamics* — Adrian Bejan. Develops exergy balances, entropy generation minimization, and optimal thermodynamic design.
- *Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics* — J. M. Smith, Hendrick C. Van Ness & Michael M. Abbott. Treats irreversibility in reacting and multicomponent systems with practical examples.

## Engine Case Studies
- *Thermal Design and Optimization* — Adrian Bejan, George Tsatsaronis & Michael Moran. Links cycle modeling, economic factors, and irreversibility distributions.
- *Combined-Cycle Gas & Steam Turbine Power Plants* — R. Kehlhofer et al.. Demonstrates how real components degrade efficiency and how to recover performance.

## Entropy Production Analysis
- *Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics* — Yasar Demirel. Explores entropy generation, internal irreversibility mapping, and coupling to transport processes.
- *Finite Time Thermodynamics and Thermoeconomics* — Raúl Alvarado & Alejandro Medina. Focuses on finite-rate constraints and optimization under irreversibility.
