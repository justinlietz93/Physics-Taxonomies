# S2-L7_Reciprocating_Engine_Cycle_Diagnostics_Lab — Species Index
**Definition:** Lab for diagnosing deviations in reciprocating engine cycles using indicator diagrams and emissions data.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## 60–90s Explanation Notes
- Capture cylinder pressure traces, fuel timing, and knock indicators to compare against ideal Otto/Diesel plots.
- Discuss maintenance actions—injector cleaning, valve lash—that restore efficiency and emissions targets.
- Tie results to fleet dispatch decisions so reliability teams see the payoff.
