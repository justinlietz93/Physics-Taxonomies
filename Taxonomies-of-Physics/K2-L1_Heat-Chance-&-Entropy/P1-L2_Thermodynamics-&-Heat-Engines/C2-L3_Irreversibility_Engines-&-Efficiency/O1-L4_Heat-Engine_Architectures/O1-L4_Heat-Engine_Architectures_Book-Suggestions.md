# O1 Heat-Engine Architectures — Book Suggestions

These books compare piston, turbine, and combined-cycle layouts, pairing thermodynamic ideals with mechanical realities.

## Reciprocating & Combustion Engines
- *Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals* — John B. Heywood. Deep coverage of Otto and Diesel cycles, volumetric efficiency, and combustion irreversibilities.
- *The Design and Tuning of Competition Engines* — Philip H. Smith & John Morrison. Practical tuning insight for compression ratios, valve timing, and exhaust energy recovery.

## Turbine and Brayton Systems
- *Gas Turbine Engineering Handbook* — Meherwan P. Boyce. Component-level maps, performance corrections, and regenerator strategies for stationary and aviation gas turbines.
- *Aircraft Propulsion* — Saeed Farokhi. Connects turbine thermodynamic cycles to hardware selections like compressors, combustors, and nozzles.

## Combined and Advanced Cycles
- *Combined Cycle Systems for Near-Zero Emission Power Generation* — Ashok Rao, Ramanan Krishnamurthy & Gabriel Radman. Explores cascading Brayton, Rankine, and fuel-cell hybrids.
- *Exergy Analysis for Energy Conversion Systems* — Efstathios Michaelides. Uses exergy-based diagnostics to benchmark architecture upgrades across fossil, solar, and nuclear plants.
