# O2 Waste Heat Recovery & Regeneration — Book Suggestions

These resources survey how to reclaim low-grade thermal energy using regenerators, bottoming cycles, and solid-state converters.

## Heat Exchanger and Recuperator Design
- *Compact Heat Exchangers* — J.E. Hesselgreaves, Richard Law & David Reay. Provides design charts, effectiveness-NTU methods, and case studies of regenerators and recuperators.
- *Process Heat Transfer* — Donald Q. Kern. Classic treatment of exchanger sizing and fouling considerations for industrial waste-heat capture.

## Bottoming Cycle Technologies
- *Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Power Systems* — Sylvain Quoilin et al. Comprehensive coverage of working-fluid selection, expander choices, and techno-economics.
- *Waste Heat Recovery: Principles and Practices* — V. Ganapathy. Explores HRSGs, combined cycles, and retrofits for petrochemical and power plants.

## Emerging Harvesting Approaches
- *Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting* — Mickaël Lallart (ed.). Reviews material science, module design, and system integration for Seebeck-based recovery.
- *Low-Grade Heat Energy Harvesting* — Changying Ji & Sami D. Salman. Surveys absorption refrigeration, phase-change storage, and small-scale generators tailored to low-temperature sources.
