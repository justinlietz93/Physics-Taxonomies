# C2 Scaling, Universality & Renormalization — Book Suggestions

Scaling and renormalization explain why diverse systems share critical behavior. These references develop RG flows, universality classes, and scaling relations.

## Renormalization Theory
- *Scaling and Renormalization in Statistical Physics* — John Cardy. Introduces renormalization group concepts with clear examples.
- *The Renormalization Group* — Michael E. Fisher. Collected lectures detailing critical exponents, fixed points, and universality.

## Critical Phenomena
- *Statistical Mechanics of Phase Transitions* — J. M. Yeomans. Applies scaling arguments to magnets, fluids, and superconductors.
- *Phase Transitions and Renormalization Group* — Jean Zinn-Justin. Provides field-theoretic treatments of criticality and perturbative RG.

## Applications
- *Universal Critical Phenomena* — Luciano Pietronero. Connects scaling to fractals, turbulence, and percolation.
- *Dynamics of Critical Phenomena* — P. C. Hohenberg & B. I. Halperin. Classifies dynamic universality classes and scaling of time-dependent correlations.
