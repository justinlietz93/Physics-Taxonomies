# O1 Order Parameter Landscapes — Book Suggestions

These texts focus on Landau-Ginzburg potentials, interface energetics, and how order-parameter landscapes reflect universality classes.

## Landau-Ginzburg Foundations
- *Statistical Physics of Fields* — Mehran Kardar. Provides derivations of functional integrals, saddle points, and interface solutions.
- *Phase Transitions and Renormalization Group* — Jean Zinn-Justin. Deep exploration of effective potentials and fluctuations around minima.

## Interface and Pattern Formation
- *Pattern Formation and Dynamics in Nonequilibrium Systems* — Michael Cross & Henry Greenside. Examines order-parameter fields and domain-wall solutions in driven systems.
- *Domain Walls in Integrable Field Theory* — Patrick Dorey et al. Specialized monograph on kink solutions and their energetic costs.

## Computational Approaches
- *Computational Physics of Soft Matter: From Lattice Boltzmann to Active Matter* — Giuseppe Gonnella & Antonio Lamura. Shows numerical minimization of Landau free energies for complex order parameters.
- *Phase-Field Methods in Materials Science and Engineering* — Alain Karma & Wouter-Jan Rappel. Practical algorithms for evolving order-parameter landscapes and interfaces.
