# O1 Symmetry Breaking Classes — Book Suggestions

These references categorize phase transitions by their symmetry properties, from Ising-like to gauge symmetry breaking.

## Symmetry and Order Parameters
- *Group Theory and Its Application to Physical Problems* — Morton Hamermesh. Builds representation theory foundations for classifying broken symmetries.
- *Statistical Mechanics of Phase Transitions* — J.M. Yeomans. Provides examples of \(Z_{2}\), \(U(1)\), and \(O(n)\) symmetry breaking in spin and superfluid systems.

## Topological and Gauge Aspects
- *Topological Defects and the Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Symmetry Breaking Phase Transitions* — Yuriy M. Bunkov & Henri Godfrin (eds.). Focus on defect classification via homotopy groups.
- *Gauge Theories in Particle Physics* — Ian J.R. Aitchison & Anthony J.G. Hey. Explains spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking and Higgs mechanism analogies.

## Advanced Monographs
- *Quantum Field Theory of Many-Body Systems* — Xiao-Gang Wen. Connects symmetry breaking with emergent gauge structures and topological order.
- *Order, Disorder and Criticality* — Yurii Holovatch (ed.). Collection exploring different universality classes and symmetry-based classification schemes.
