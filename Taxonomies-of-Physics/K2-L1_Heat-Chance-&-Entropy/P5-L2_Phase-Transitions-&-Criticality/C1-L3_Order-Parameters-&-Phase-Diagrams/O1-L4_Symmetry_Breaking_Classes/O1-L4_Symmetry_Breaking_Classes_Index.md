# O1-L4_Symmetry_Breaking_Classes — Order Index
**Definition:** Catalog discrete, continuous, and topological order parameters with their broken symmetries.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Family (L5) — index
- **F1-L5_Discrete_Order_Stories** — Ising-like flips, structural transitions, and crystal symmetries.
- **F2-L5_Continuous_and_Topological_Cases** — superfluid, magnetic, and defect-protected orders.
