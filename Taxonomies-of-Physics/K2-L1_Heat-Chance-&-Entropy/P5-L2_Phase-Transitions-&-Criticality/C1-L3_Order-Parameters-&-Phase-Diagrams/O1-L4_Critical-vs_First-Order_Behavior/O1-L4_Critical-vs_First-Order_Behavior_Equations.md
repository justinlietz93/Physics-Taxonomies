# O1 Critical vs First-Order Behavior â€” Core Equations

Critical transitions exhibit continuous order parameters and diverging susceptibilities, while first-order transitions jump and involve latent heat. These equations capture diagnostic signatures.

## Order Parameter Behavior
**Critical scaling:**

$$M \sim |T - T_{c}|^{\beta}$$

- Order parameter \(M\) approaches zero continuously with exponent \(\beta\) near critical temperature \(T_c\).

**First-order discontinuity:**

$$\Delta M = M_{+} - M_{-} \neq 0$$

- Finite jump between phases \(M_{\pm}\) at the transition temperature evidences first-order character.

## Thermodynamic Signatures
**Latent heat:**

$$L = T_{t} \Delta S$$

- First-order transitions release/absorb finite heat determined by entropy jump \(\Delta S\) at transition temperature \(T_t\).

**Heat capacity divergence:**

$$C \sim |T - T_{c}|^{-\alpha}$$

- Critical points show power-law divergence with exponent \(\alpha\); first-order transitions display delta-function spikes instead.

## Susceptibility and Correlation Length
**Magnetic susceptibility:**

$$\chi \sim |T - T_{c}|^{-\gamma}$$

- Diverges at continuous transitions, finite across first-order transitions.

**Correlation length:**

$$\xi \sim |T - T_{c}|^{-\nu}$$

- Diverging length scale is hallmark of criticality; finite correlation length persists in first-order cases.

## Landau Free Energy Landscapes
**Fourth-order Landau expansion:**

$$f(M) = f_{0} + a (T - T_{c}) M^{2} + b M^{4}$$

- For \(b > 0\), yields continuous transitions with single-well flattening.

**Cubic term for first-order:**

$$f(M) = f_{0} + a (T - T_{0}) M^{2} - w M^{3} + b M^{4}$$

- Negative cubic coefficient \(w\) introduces barrier causing coexistence and latent heat.
