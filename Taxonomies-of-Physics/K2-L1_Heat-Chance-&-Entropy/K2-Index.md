# Heat, Chance, & Entropy (why things even out)

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Phylum

- **Thermodynamics** — energy, work, heat, engines; *fridges, kettles*.
- **Statistical Physics** — many-microstates → temperature/entropy; *shuffling decks*.
- **Transport & Nonequilibrium** — diffusion, conduction, advection; *smells spreading*.
- **Fluctuations & Noise** — random kicks, Brownian motion; *pollen jitter*.
- **Phase Transitions & Criticality** — sudden order/disorder; *boiling, magnets*.
