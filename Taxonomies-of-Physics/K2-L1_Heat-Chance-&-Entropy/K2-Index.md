# K2–L1 Heat, Chance, & Entropy
**Definition:** How energy spreads, random fluctuations emerge, and order reshapes when many particles jostle and trade energy.

## Overarching Lenses

- **Lens A: Symmetry -> Conservation (Noether)**: sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
- **Lens B: Frames & Relativity**: who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
- **Lens C: Quantization**: ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
- **Lens D: Fields & Gauge**: forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
- **Lens E: Randomness & Entropy**: many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
- **Lens F: Scale & Renormalization**: what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
- **Lens G: Topology & Phases**: protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

## Native questions
- How does energy flow or even out between parts of the system?
- Which constraints or reservoirs set temperature, pressure, or chemical balance?
- What random events or correlations matter most at the scale we care about?

## Everyday anchors
- Cooking with stovetops, ovens, and pressure cookers.
- Weather fronts distributing heat and moisture.
- Ice melting into water during spring thaw.
