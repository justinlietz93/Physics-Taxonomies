# O1 Ensemble-Based Estimators — Book Suggestions

These works teach how to turn ensemble samples into reliable estimates of thermodynamic observables.

## Statistical Estimation Foundations
- *Statistical Data Analysis* — Glen Cowan. Covers estimators, error propagation, and likelihood methods adaptable to ensemble outputs.
- *Monte Carlo Statistical Methods* — Christian Robert & George Casella. Provides rigorous treatment of sampling, autocorrelation, and variance reduction.

## Thermodynamic & Free-Energy Estimation
- *Free Energy Calculations in Rational Drug Design* — M.R. Reddy & M.D. Erion (eds.). Practical guidance on free-energy perturbation and Bennett acceptance-ratio estimators.
- *Understanding Molecular Simulation* — Daan Frenkel & Berend Smit. Step-by-step methods for computing ensemble averages, correlation times, and error bars.

## Advanced Sampling & Reweighting
- *Bayesian Data Analysis* — Andrew Gelman et al. Offers hierarchical modeling and reweighting perspectives valuable for ensemble inference.
- *Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Molecular Simulation* — Mark Tuckerman. Links ensemble estimators with molecular dynamics algorithms, including WHAM and umbrella sampling.
