# O1 Ensemble Formulations — Book Suggestions

These books build fluency with microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensemble construction, highlighting when each description shines.

## Core Statistical Mechanics Texts
- *Statistical Physics* (Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 5) — Landau & Lifshitz. Elegant derivations of ensemble partition functions and equivalence arguments.
- *Statistical Mechanics* — Kerson Huang. Direct, calculation-heavy exposition of canonical and grand canonical formalisms.

## Conceptual Guides
- *Equilibrium Statistical Physics* — Michael Plischke & Birger Bergersen. Connects probability foundations with thermodynamic potentials and fluctuation measures.
- *Thermal Physics* — Charles Kittel & Herbert Kroemer. Provides intuitive bridges between macroscopic thermodynamics and ensemble language.

## Advanced & Specialized Treatments
- *Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations* — Werner Krauth. Highlights Monte Carlo and Markov-chain sampling tailored to ensemble viewpoints.
- *Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation: Methods and Applications* — Jun-Sheng Li et al. Focuses on open systems and how grand canonical weighting informs computational practice.
