# O2 Counting Methods & Approximations — Book Suggestions

These books emphasize combinatorics, asymptotics, and approximation techniques for enumerating microstates across classical and quantum systems.

## Combinatorics & Asymptotics
- *Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis* — John Riordan. Covers binomial, multinomial, and occupancy problems essential for statistical counting.
- *Asymptotic Methods in Statistical Mechanics* — Nicolaas G. van Kampen. Explores steepest descents, saddle points, and large-deviation expansions tailored to partition sums.

## Quantum Statistics Resources
- *Statistical Physics of Particles* — Mehran Kardar. Detailed derivations of Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac counting with Stirling approximations.
- *Pathria & Beale's Statistical Mechanics* — R.K. Pathria & Paul D. Beale. Includes combinatorial derivations and corrections for indistinguishable particles.

## Numerical & Computational Approaches
- *Monte Carlo Methods in Statistical Physics* — Mark E. J. Newman & G. T. Barkema. Shows how importance sampling and histogram methods approximate degeneracies.
- *Large Deviation Techniques and Applications* — Amir Dembo & Ofer Zeitouni. Provides mathematical foundations for rate functions and rare-event probabilities used in modern counting problems.
