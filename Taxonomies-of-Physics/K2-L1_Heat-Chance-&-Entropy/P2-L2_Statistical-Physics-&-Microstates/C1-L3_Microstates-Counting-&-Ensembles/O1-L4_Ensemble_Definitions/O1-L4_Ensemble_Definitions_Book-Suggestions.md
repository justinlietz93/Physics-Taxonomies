# O1 Ensemble Definitions — Book Suggestions

These references emphasize the axioms, probability theory, and conceptual structure underpinning ensemble definitions before diving into calculations.

## Probability & Foundations
- *Probability in Physics* — Yemima Ben-Menahem & Meir Hemmo (eds.). Philosophical and mathematical essays clarifying equal a priori weighting and objective vs subjective views.
- *Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics* — E.T. Jaynes (collected papers). Grounds maximum entropy reasoning for defining ensembles from limited data.

## Pedagogical Treatments
- *An Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics* — Robert H. Swendsen. Patient derivations of ensemble postulates, normalization, and thermodynamic consistency.
- *Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity* — James P. Sethna. Focuses on the logic of probability assignments and how they morph between ensembles.

## Advanced Perspectives
- *Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics* — Carolyne M. Van Vliet. Provides rigorous measure-theoretic definitions of ensembles and discusses extensions to nonequilibrium settings.
- *Statistical Mechanics in a Nutshell* — Luca Peliti. Compact summary of ensembles with emphasis on variational principles and constraint handling.
