# C1 Microstates, Counting & Ensembles — Book Suggestions

Counting microstates bridges microscopic models to macroscopic laws. These books lay out combinatorics, ensemble definitions, and distribution functions that power statistical mechanics.

## Foundational Texts
- *Statistical Physics* — Lev D. Landau & Evgeny M. Lifshitz. Derives ensembles and thermodynamic connections from first principles.
- *Statistical Mechanics* — R. K. Pathria & Paul D. Beale. Covers microcanonical, canonical, and grand-canonical formalisms with detailed derivations and examples.

## Counting Techniques
- *An Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics* — Robert H. Swendsen. Highlights combinatorial arguments and entropy from multiplicity.
- *Thermal Physics* — Charles Kittel & Herbert Kroemer. Uses accessible models—Einstein solids, ideal gases—to illustrate counting and ensemble averaging.

## Applications
- *Statistical Physics of Particles* — Mehran Kardar. Connects microstate counting to fluctuations, criticality, and quantum statistics.
- *Equilibrium Statistical Physics* — Michael Plischke & Birger Bergersen. Applies ensemble methods to magnets, fluids, and quantum gases.
