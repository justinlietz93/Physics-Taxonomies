# K2 Heat, Chance & Entropy — Core Equations

Thermal physics weaves energy bookkeeping with probability. These kingdom-level relations state the conservation, transport, and statistical structure that the downstream phyla elaborate.

## Energy & the First Law
**First law (differential form):**

$$(dU = \delta Q - \delta W)$$

- The internal energy change \(dU\) equals heat inflow \(\delta Q\) minus work \(\delta W\) done by the system.

**Heat capacity at constant pressure:**

$$(Q = n C_{p} \Delta T)$$

- Heating \(n\) moles by temperature \(\Delta T\) at constant pressure requires heat set by the molar heat capacity \(C_{p}\).

**Enthalpy definition:**

$$(H = U + P V)$$

- Enthalpy combines internal energy \(U\) with pressure–volume work \(P V\), simplifying flow energy balances.

## Equations of State & Cycles
**Ideal gas law:**

$$(P V = n R T)$$

- Pressure \(P\), volume \(V\), amount of substance \(n\), and temperature \(T\) relate through the gas constant \(R\).

**Carnot efficiency:**

$$(\eta_{\text{Carnot}} = 1 - \tfrac{T_{\text{cold}}}{T_{\text{hot}}})$$

- The maximum efficiency \(\eta\) depends only on the hot and cold reservoir temperatures.

**Clausius inequality:**

$$(\oint \tfrac{\delta Q}{T} \le 0)$$

- For any cyclic process the integral of heat over temperature is non-positive, signaling irreversibility.

## Entropy & Probability
**Entropy differential:**

$$(dS = \tfrac{\delta Q_{\text{rev}}}{T})$$

- For reversible transfers, the entropy change \(dS\) equals heat \(\delta Q_{\text{rev}}\) divided by absolute temperature \(T\).

**Boltzmann entropy:**

$$(S = k_{B} \ln \Omega)$$

- Entropy \(S\) counts microstates \(\Omega\) weighted by Boltzmann's constant \(k_{B}\).

**Gibbs entropy:**

$$(S = -k_{B} \sum_{i} p_{i} \ln p_{i})$$

- Probabilities \(p_{i}\) for microstates set the statistical entropy for systems beyond equal-likelihood ensembles.

## Transport & Relaxation
**Fourier's law of heat conduction:**

$$(\mathbf{q} = -k \nabla T)$$

- Heat flux density \(\mathbf{q}\) flows down temperature gradients \(\nabla T\) with thermal conductivity \(k\).

**Fick's first law (particle diffusion):**

$$(\mathbf{J} = -D \nabla c)$$

- Particle flux \(\mathbf{J}\) follows concentration gradients \(\nabla c\) scaled by diffusivity \(D\).

**Newton's law of cooling:**

$$(\tfrac{dQ}{dt} = -h A (T - T_{\infty}))$$

- Convective heat loss rate depends on heat transfer coefficient \(h\), surface area \(A\), and temperature difference to the environment \(T - T_{\infty}\).

## Statistical Ensembles
**Partition function (canonical ensemble):**

$$(Z = \sum_{i} e^{-\beta E_{i}})$$

- The sum over states with energies \(E_{i}\) and \(\beta = 1/(k_{B} T)\) encodes all equilibrium averages.

**Helmholtz free energy:**

$$(F = -k_{B} T \ln Z)$$

- Free energy \(F\) sets the minimum work extractable at constant temperature and volume.

**Fluctuation-dissipation preview:**

$$(\langle (\Delta X)^{2} \rangle = k_{B} T (\tfrac{\partial X}{\partial Y})_{T})$$

- Thermal fluctuations \(\langle (\Delta X)^{2} \rangle\) link to response coefficients, foreshadowing noise and transport phyla.

These relations spotlight how energy, entropy, and probability entwine—guiding the L2 branches into engines, transport, criticality, and fluctuations.
