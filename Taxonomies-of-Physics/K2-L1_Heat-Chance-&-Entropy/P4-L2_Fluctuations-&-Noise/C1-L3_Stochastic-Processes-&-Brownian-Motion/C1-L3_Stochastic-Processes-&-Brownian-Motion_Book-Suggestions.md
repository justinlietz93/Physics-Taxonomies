# C1 Stochastic Processes & Brownian Motion — Book Suggestions

Brownian motion exemplifies random forcing and diffusive transport. These books develop stochastic calculus, Langevin dynamics, and experimental benchmarks.

## Stochastic Foundations
- *Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry* — N. G. Van Kampen. Treats Markov processes, master equations, and noise calculus.
- *Stochastic Differential Equations* — Bernt Øksendal. Introduces Ito and Stratonovich integrals used to model Brownian-driven systems.

## Brownian Motion
- *An Introduction to Stochastic Processes in Physics* — Don S. Lemons & Anthony Gythiel. Focuses on the Langevin equation, diffusion, and fluctuation-dissipation.
- *The Fokker-Planck Equation* — Hannes Risken. Provides solution techniques for probability density evolution in Brownian systems.

## Experimental Narratives
- *Einstein's Miraculous Year* — John Stachel (ed.). Collects seminal Brownian motion papers connecting theory to experiments.
- *Microrheology* — T. A. Waigh. Uses Brownian probes to measure viscoelastic properties in soft matter.
