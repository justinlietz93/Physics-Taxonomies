# O1 Random Walk Formalisms — Book Suggestions

These books develop discrete and continuous random walk frameworks, first-passage theory, and anomalous diffusion.

## Classical Random Walk Texts
- *Random Walks and Electric Networks* — Peter G. Doyle & J. Laurie Snell. Connects discrete walks with network analogies and harmonic functions.
- *Random Walks in Biology* — Howard C. Berg. Provides intuitive explanations of diffusion, chemotaxis, and biased random walks.

## Mathematical Foundations
- *Random Walks and Electric Networks* — Geoffrey Grimmett & David Stirzaker. Comprehensive mathematical treatment of random walks and hitting times.
- *First-Passage Phenomena and Their Applications* — Ralf Metzler et al. Collection focused on first-passage problems across physics and chemistry.

## Anomalous Diffusion & CTRW
- *Anomalous Transport: Foundations and Applications* — Ralf Metzler, Gleb Oshanin & Sidney Redner. Highlights continuous-time random walks and fractional diffusion.
- *A Guide to First-Passage Processes* — Sidney Redner. Deep dive into hitting probabilities and survival scaling laws.
