# O1 Noise Spectrum Taxonomy — Book Suggestions

These resources catalogue noise spectra across disciplines and explain the statistics used to classify them.

## Noise Reference Compendia
- *Handbook of Noise and Vibration Control* — Malcolm J. Crocker (ed.). Comprehensive tables of spectral signatures across mechanical and acoustic systems.
- *The Noise Measurement Manual* — Peter E. Corthorne. Practical guidance on spectral weighting, bandwidth selection, and measurement uncertainty.

## Time-Frequency Diagnostics
- *Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control* — George E.P. Box, Gwilym M. Jenkins & Gregory C. Reinsel. Introduces spectral slope estimation and diagnostic plots for different noise types.
- *Statistical Digital Signal Processing and Modeling* — Monson H. Hayes. Covers periodograms, multitaper methods, and coherence analysis for noise taxonomy.

## Specialty Topics
