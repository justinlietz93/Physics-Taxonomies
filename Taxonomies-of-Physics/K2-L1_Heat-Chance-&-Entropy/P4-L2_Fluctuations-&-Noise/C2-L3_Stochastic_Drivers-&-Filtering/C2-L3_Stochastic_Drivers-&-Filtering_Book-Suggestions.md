# C2 Stochastic Drivers & Filtering — Book Suggestions

Filtering techniques extract signals driven by random forces. These references span power spectral methods, stochastic calculus, and Kalman filtering in noisy environments.

## Noise Characterization
- *Random Data: Analysis and Measurement Procedures* — Julius S. Bendat & Allan G. Piersol. Covers spectral estimation, coherence, and noise models.
- *Signals and Noise* — David Middleton. Presents statistical descriptions of physical noise sources and their transformations.

## Filtering & Control
- *Optimal Filtering* — Brian D. O. Anderson & John B. Moore. Derives Kalman and Wiener filters for linear stochastic systems.
- *Stochastic Processes and Filtering Theory* — Andrew H. Jazwinski. Extends filtering to nonlinear and continuous-time settings.

## Applications
- *Statistical Signal Processing* — Louis L. Scharf. Applies detection and estimation theory to noisy physical measurements.
- *Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing* — Simo Särkkä. Provides modern algorithms for sequential inference with stochastic drivers.
