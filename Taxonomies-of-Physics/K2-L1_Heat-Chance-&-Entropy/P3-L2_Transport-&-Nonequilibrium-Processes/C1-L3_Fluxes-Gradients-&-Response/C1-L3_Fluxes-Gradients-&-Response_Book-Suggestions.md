# C1 Fluxes, Gradients & Response — Book Suggestions

Transport processes tie gradients to fluxes in heat, mass, and momentum. These references emphasize constitutive laws, response coefficients, and measurement across fluids and solids.

## Core Transport Texts
- *Transport Phenomena* — R. Byron Bird, Warren E. Stewart & Edwin N. Lightfoot. Unifies heat, mass, and momentum transport with vector and tensor treatments.
- *Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer* — Frank P. Incropera et al.. Provides applied examples and property data for conduction, convection, and diffusion.

## Linear Response Theory
- *Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics* — S. R. De Groot & P. Mazur. Derives flux-force relationships and reciprocal coefficients.
- *Statistical Physics of Particles* — Mehran Kardar. Connects microscopic fluctuations to macroscopic response via Green–Kubo relations.

## Measurement & Modeling
- *Experimental Methods for Engineers* — J. P. Holman. Covers techniques for measuring gradients, fluxes, and transport coefficients.
- *Computational Transport Phenomena* — W. E. Schiesser & Graham W. Griffiths. Demonstrates numerical schemes for coupled transport equations.
