# O1 Linear vs Nonlinear Transport — Book Suggestions

These titles distinguish the comfort zone of linear transport laws from regimes where constitutive relations bend.

## Linear Response Classics
- *Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics* — S. R. De Groot & P. Mazur. Canonical treatment of linear phenomenological laws and Onsager reciprocity.
- *Transport Phenomena* — R. Byron Bird, Warren E. Stewart & Edwin N. Lightfoot. Engineering perspective on heat, mass, and momentum transport within linear regimes.

## Nonlinear Transport & Extensions
- *Advanced Transport Phenomena* — L. Gary Leal. Analyzes nonlinear effects in momentum and mass transport with perturbation expansions.
- *Nonlinear Transport in Complex Systems* — Sergey S. Koshevnik. Explores conductivity, diffusion, and rheological behaviors beyond linear response.

## Diagnostics and Scaling
- *Scaling, Self-Similarity, and Intermediate Asymptotics* — Grigory Barenblatt. Provides similarity techniques to interpret departures from linear transport.
- *Non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics and Turbulence* — Sergey Nazarenko. Discusses how turbulence and strong gradients generate nonlinear transport coefficients.
