# C2 Flows, Driving Forces & Couplings — Book Suggestions

Coupled transport arises when gradients in one quantity drive fluxes in another. These references cover cross-effects, coupled flows, and thermodynamic forces in complex media.

## Coupled Transport Theory
- *Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics* — S. R. De Groot & P. Mazur. Develops Onsager reciprocity and coupled flux-force formulations.
- *Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes* — Ilya Prigogine. Explores dissipative structures and cross-coupled transport beyond near equilibrium.

## Applications
- *Thermoelectrics: Basic Principles and New Materials Developments* — G. S. Nolas, J. Sharp & H. J. Goldsmid. Illustrates heat-electrical coupling in energy conversion.
- *Membrane Transport in Biology* — Wilfred D. Stein. Shows chemical and electrical driving forces generating flows across membranes.

## Modeling & Measurement
- *Convective Transport Processes* — William M. Deen. Analyzes coupled heat and mass transfer in engineering systems.
- *Electrochemical Systems* — John Newman & Karen E. Thomas-Alyea. Covers ionic transport, electrochemical potentials, and coupled reaction-flow models.
