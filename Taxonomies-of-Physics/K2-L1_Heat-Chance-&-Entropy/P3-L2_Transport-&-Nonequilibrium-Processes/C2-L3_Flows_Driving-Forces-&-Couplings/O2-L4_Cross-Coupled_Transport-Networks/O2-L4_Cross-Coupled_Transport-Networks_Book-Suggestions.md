# O2 Cross-Coupled Transport Networks — Book Suggestions

These resources address coupled hydraulic, thermal, electrical, and mass-transport networks and the algorithms needed to solve them.

## Network Theory Foundations
- *Network Analysis* — M.E. Van Valkenburg. Classic text on Kirchhoff-like laws and matrix methods readily adapted to transport networks.
- *Graph Theory and Its Engineering Applications* — Wei-Kao Chen. Demonstrates incidence matrices, loop equations, and network reductions for multiport systems.

## Multiphysics Network Modeling
- *District Heating and Cooling Networks* — Stefano Mazzoni. Integrates hydraulic and thermal balances for urban energy systems.
- *Modeling and Optimization of Energy Systems* — Alireza Soroudi. Presents coupled energy-flow equations linking electrical, thermal, and gas networks.

## Numerical Solution Techniques
- *Finite Element and Finite Volume Methods for Heat Transfer* — Jian Su & Ya-Ling He. Provides discretization strategies for networked conduction–convection problems.
- *Multiphysics Simulation by Design for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics, and Drives* — S. Wiak & K. Komeza. Focuses on coupled circuit–field models and solver stability criteria.
