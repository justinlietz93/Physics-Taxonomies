# Depth model (high → low)

**L0. Picture** — the mental movie (one of the five).
**L1. Kingdom** — Mechanics, Heat/Chance, Waves/Fields, Matter, Fluids/Plasmas, EM & Light, Quantum, Gravity/Cosmos.
**L2. Phylum** — big subdivisions inside a Kingdom (3–5 per).
**L3. Class (canonical models)** — the standard toys everyone uses to think (e.g., “mass–spring,” “ideal gas,” “plane wave”).
**L4. Order (regimes/approximations)** — where the model lives: small vs large, slow vs fast, weak vs strong, noisy vs clean.
**L5. Family (canonical problems)** — named patterns you’ll see again and again.
**L6. Species (everyday exemplars)** — concrete, memorable cases you can explain in 60–90 seconds.

> For your create-first style: **stop at L6**. Each Species gets a sketch + one-minute explanation. No equations needed to learn the structure.

## What this looks like (two worked Kingdoms)

### Kingdom: Mechanics (Things that move & push) — Picture: Hills & Balls / Springs

* **Phyla (L2):** Particles & Rigid Bodies; Energy Landscapes; Oscillations; Nonlinear/Chaos.
* **Class (L3) — Oscillations:** Simple harmonic oscillator; Damped; Driven; Coupled.
* **Order (L4):** light vs heavy damping; near vs far from resonance; weak vs strong coupling.
* **Family (L5):** mass–spring; pendulum (small-angle); two-mass coupling; parametric swing.
* **Species (L6):** door closer, kid on a swing, two metronomes syncing on a shared board, a bridge swaying in wind.

### Kingdom: Electromagnetism & Light — Picture: Ripples & Waves (in fields)

* **Phyla (L2):** Electrostatics; Magnetostatics; Maxwell Waves; Circuits.
* **Class (L3) — Circuits:** DC; AC steady-state; Transients; Transmission lines.
* **Order (L4):** low vs high frequency; lumped vs distributed; weak vs strong coupling to antennas.
* **Family (L5):** RC step response; RLC resonance; quarter-wave antenna; waveguide modes.
* **Species (L6):** phone charging brick (RC), guitar pickup + amp (RLC), microwave oven cavity mode, Wi-Fi router antenna.

## How many levels are “possible”?

* **Theoretical max:** unlimited (you can always subdivide).
* **Useful for learning:** **6 levels** is plenty (Picture → Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Species).
* **Rule of thumb:** Aim for **3–5 items per level** so your tree stays legible.

---

## Stop rules (keep it from exploding)

* If two leaves (Species) have the **same one-minute explanation**, merge them.
* If a node (Family or Order) **doesn’t change the story you’d tell**, drop that level.
* If you can’t name a **real-world Species** for a Family, it’s too abstract—go back up.

## One-page template you can copy for any Kingdom

* **Picture (L0):** __________________________
* **Kingdom (L1):** __________________________
* **Phyla (L2, 3–5 items):** ____, ____, ____
* **Classes (L3) for one Phylum:** ____, ____, ____
* **Orders (L4) for one Class:** ____, ____
* **Families (L5):** ____, ____
* **Species (L6, 3 examples):**

  1. ______ (60–90s explanation)
  2. ______ ( ” )
  3. ______ ( ” )

Fill that for the Kingdom you want to learn next, and we’ll flesh it out together. If you tell me which Kingdom to start with (e.g., “Electromagnetism” or “Fluids”), I’ll build the full 6-level tree with vivid Species so you can learn top-down, fast.
