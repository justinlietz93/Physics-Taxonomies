Love it. Here’s your **Animal-Kingdom–style map of physics**, tuned to your create-first, analogy-driven brain. Think **Kingdom → Phyla → (signature questions & everyday anchors)**. No equations—just pictures, stories, and the right questions to ask.

# Kingdom 1 — **Mechanics (Things that move & push)**

**Core pictures:** Hills & Balls · Springs & Oscillations
**Phyla**

* **Particles & Rigid Bodies** (motion, forces, momentum)

* **Oscillations & Resonance** (why things wiggle, when they explode)
* **Nonlinear Dynamics & Chaos** (sensitive dependence, attractors)
  **Native questions:** What’s pushing? What resists? Where’s downhill? What sets the rhythm?
  **Everyday anchors:** Biking uphill; a door closer spring; a child on a swing.
  **Bridges:** Feeds waves (Kingdom 3), relates to symmetry → conservation (Lens A).

**Core pictures:** Buckets & Flows · Smearing & Diffusion
**Phyla**

* **Thermodynamics** (energy, work, heat, engines)

  **Everyday anchors:** Echoes in a room; ripples in a pond; noise-canceling headphones.
  **Bridges:** Touches electromagnetism (Kingdom 6) and quantum (Kingdom 7).

# Kingdom 4 — **Matter & Materials (How stuff organizes)**

**Core pictures:** Springs & Oscillations · Smearing & Diffusion
**Phyla**

  **Native questions:** What’s the “springiness”? How do defects/impurities act? Is there a protected count (topology)?
  **Everyday anchors:** Guitar strings (stiffness vs pitch); silly putty vs glass; non-stick pans.
  **Bridges:** Uses heat/chance (Kingdom 2) and waves (3); meets quantum rules (7).

# Kingdom 5 — **Fluids & Plasmas (Stuff that flows)**

**Core pictures:** Buckets & Flows · Ripples & Waves · Smearing & Diffusion
**Phyla**

* **Hydrodynamics** (laminar vs turbulent)
* **Geophysical & Astro Fluids** (weather, oceans, disks)

  **Native questions:** Where’s the pressure difference? Is the flow smooth or chaotic? Are charges riding along fields?
  **Everyday anchors:** Smoke plumes; bathtub vortex; auroras.
  **Bridges:** Glues to electromagnetism (6) and heat/transport (2).

# Kingdom 6 — **Electromagnetism & Light (Forces through space)**

**Core pictures:** Ripples & Waves (in fields)
**Phyla**

* **Electrostatics/Magnetostatics** (charges, currents, fields)
* **Maxwell Waves** (light as EM waves; antennas, cavities)

  **Native questions:** Where’s the field strongest? What’s the path for energy/flow? What boundaries shape the modes?
  **Everyday anchors:** Phone chargers; Wi-Fi; microwave ovens.
  **Bridges:** Sets the stage for quantum (7) and optics (3).

# Kingdom 7 — **Quantum & Quanta (The staircase world)**

**Core pictures:** Springs & Oscillations · Ripples & Waves
**Phyla**

* **Quantum Mechanics** (levels, superposition, measurement)
* **Quantum Statistics** (fermions/bosons; degeneracy pressure)

  **Native questions:** Is behavior staircase-like (quantized)? What symmetries constrain outcomes? How does randomness enter?
  **Everyday anchors:** LEDs and lasers; MRI; semiconductor chips.
  **Bridges:** Runs through materials (4), nuclei (8), and fundamental forces.

# Kingdom 8 — **Gravity, Spacetime & Cosmos (The shape of the stage)**

**Core pictures:** Hills & Balls (but the hill is spacetime itself)
**Phyla**

* **Relativity (Special & General)** (frames, time dilation; curvature = gravity)
* **Astrophysics** (stars, black holes, galaxies)
* **Cosmology** (expansion, structure growth)
  **Native questions:** Whose clock/ruler? How is spacetime curved here? What sets the cosmic budget (matter, radiation, dark stuff)?
  **Everyday anchors:** GPS clock corrections; gravitational lens photos.
  **Bridges:** Fluids (5) in curved spacetime; quantum gravity questions touch (7).

# Optional Kingdom 9 — **Measurement, Control & Information (How we know and steer)**

**Core pictures:** All five, focused on signals & feedback
**Phyla:** Instrumentation, signal processing, noise & filtering, control systems
**Native questions:** What’s the signal vs noise? How do we stabilize?
**Anchors:** Thermostat; noise-canceling; Kalman filter as “smart averaging.”

## Cross-cutting **Lenses** (apply anywhere; they’re your “field guides”)

* **Lens A — Symmetry → Conservation (Noether):** sameness across time/space/rotation → energy/momentum/angular momentum conserved.
* **Lens B — Frames & Relativity:** who’s measuring; speed limits; when the stage (spacetime) bends.
* **Lens C — Quantization:** ramps become staircases; waves behave as particles and vice-versa.
* **Lens D — Fields & Gauge:** forces as fields spread in space; different “potentials” = same physics.
* **Lens E — Randomness & Entropy:** many-microstates, noise, arrows of time.
* **Lens F — Scale & Renormalization:** what matters changes with zoom; universal behavior emerges.
* **Lens G — Topology & Phases:** protected counts (knots/holes) that survive deformations.

> Use flow: **pick a Kingdom (picture) → add a Lens (twist) → then dive into a specific example.**

## How to *use* this map (high → low) in 5 minutes

1. **Pick a Kingdom** that matches the phenomenon.
2. State the **picture** in one sentence (“This is a waves problem in a field”).
3. Choose **one Lens** that likely matters (symmetry? quantization? scale?).
4. Ask the **native questions** for that Kingdom out loud.
5. Only then peek at specifics (terms, diagrams), translating them into the picture+Lens story.
